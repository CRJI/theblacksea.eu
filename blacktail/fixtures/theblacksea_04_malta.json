Late 2015. Despite only being in his 30s, Daniel is following a complicated treatment for lymphatic cancer. In theory, Romania offers its citizens free healthcare. In practice, patients have to pay for essential drugs and bribe doctors, nurses and orderlies for medical services. These costs can cripple a family's finances. And Daniel is no exception. He borrowed money from relatives and friends, and took loans out from banks to by drugs to treat his cancer. But now he has run out of options.    </p>    <p>     So he turns online. To a fast loans company Zaplo. On TV and on the Internet if offers \\u201cno interest rate or commission\\u201d for the first loan. And immediate money transfer. It seems too good to be true.    </p>    <p>     Daniel makes a contract online in his wife's name, because she has a better credit history than him. That day in November 2015, 800 RON (175 Euro) flashed up in her account.    </p>    <p>     Although Daniel already had cancer, this was when his nightmare began.    </p>    <p>     Daniel was hit by bills from every direction and could not pay back the 175 Euro in time. In two months, the amount doubled to 350 Euro. Zaplo customer centers - manned by real people and robot callers - contacted him every day. They sent him emails. Letters. They wanted their money back.    </p>    <p>     They reached a deal. He would pay the 350 Euro in two tranches. At first, Daniel paid back the initial amount.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cBut after you tie yourself up, you cannot get rid of them,\\u201d he says now.    </p>    <p>     When he could not pay the second part, Zaplo took the case to court. Daniel says that his family was not told about the trial.    </p>    <p>     In late February 2017, the court imposed a foreclosure for 2,647 RON (approx. 585 Euro), which included penalties of 1,598 lei (353 Euro) and commissions - which doesn\\u2019t mention the sum that was already paid. The effective annual interest rate became 1,989 per cent.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWithout any warning, after several months, my wife received a notice from a bailiff that her account would be blocked,\\u201d Daniel says. The amount they needed to pay also included about 100 Euro for the bailiff. His wife's entire monthly income was frozen, although Romanian law states that, in such cases, only a third of the monthly income is subject to such action.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cThey deprived a family of its food,\\u201d Daniel argues.    </p>    <p>     Meanwhile, he finished the treatment for cancer. But to cover his debts, he had to migrate to Germany for work.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cI had to leave Romania because of some thieves who deceived me and lied to me,\\u201d he says.    </p>    <p>     Daniel\\u2019s case is far from singular. Zaplo IFN started to offer fast small loans in Romania in June 2015 and by April 2017 the company was involved in 1,570 cases in Romanian courts against clients - the vast majority foreclosures. The business benefits from customers not paying their loans back in time.    </p>    <p>     Other Romanian clients told us the same story of ballooning interest rates after the first month. Take 62 year-old Ana Kosa. She needed 132 Euro to cover basic expenses to supplement her 88 Euro a month pension. After failing to pay back the amount after 30 days, the costs swelled to 308 Euro, forcing the pensioner to move to Austria to work as an elderly carer.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cThey [Zaplo] kept calling me and saying they will come to recover the amount,\\u201c she says. \\u201cBut for 1,400 lei (308 Euro) what can they take from me?\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Romanian lawyer Adrian Cuculis says clients of fast loans constitute one third of his cases - a number in the high hundreds.    </p>    <p>     Zaplo IFN is not a standalone Romanian company. It is subsidiary of Latvian based AS 4finance which operates in 17 European and American countries.    </p>    <p>     4finance claims to be \\u201cEurope\\u2019s largest and fastest growing online and mobile consumer lending group\\u201d. Since establishing in 2008, it has provided more than 11.5 million loans totalling over 4.0 billion Euro.    </p>    <p>     But interest rates can increase to even 2,000 per cent per year. This has caught the attention of consumer protection agencies.    </p>    <p>     In 2016, the Finnish Consumer Ombudsman applied for an injunction on a 4finance subsidiary on the grounds of unlawful credit granting practices - stating that a 2,010 Euro credit could balloon into 4,145 Euro in six months due to late payments.    </p>    <p>     In Denmark, 4Finance subsidiary Vivus violated Danish marketing laws by stating on the website that the interest rate on a loan was 19 per cent. According to the Danish consumer ombudsman, the correct figure would have been 730.1 per cent.    </p>    <p>     While 4Finance preys on vulnerable citizens across the continent, The Malta Files can reveal how its former and current owners are using tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg, Cyprus and the Bahamas.     <strong>      The full report on this story is      <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1306&amp;recType=story\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">       here      </a>     </strong>     .    </p>    <p>     But one of the most important tax friendly country for beneficial owners who profit from poor European citizens with usurious fast loans is - Malta.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-full\\\"> <div class=\\\"image\\\" data-aos=\\\"fade\\\" data-aos-duration=\\\"800\\\" style=\\\"background-image: url('/malta-files/public/img/articles/boyko-sorina-vazelina-illustrator-2.jpg');\\\"> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Oleg Boyko: Payday Godfather    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The current owners of 4finance are Russian billionaire Oleg Boyko and his Latvian partners. They enjoy a lavish lifestyle in contrast to their clients, who are usually the working poor, captured by the marketing trap of quick and easy cash loan.    </p>    <p>     With an estimated wealth of 1.2 billion USD, Boyko is the 75th most wealthy Russian, according to Forbes. He is an owner of global private investment group Finstar Financial, which had two billion USD assets under its management in 2016.    </p>    <p>     Boyko\\u2019s Ritzio International owns more than 150 gambling clubs in countries such as Germany, Italy, Romania and Croatia. Besides Russian citizenship, Boyko obtained Italian passport in February 2008, and is a European Union citizen. Through the British Virgin Islands company FTV BVI Ltd, Boyko co-owns the Fashion TV channel, which reaches hundreds of millions of viewers in more than 140 countries. He's also connected to the Moscow elite - with close friends in Russian billionaire and Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich and first deputy Prime Minister of Russia Igor Shuvalov.    </p>    <p>     During summers, when he is not at his luxury villa in Blevio at Lake Como in Italy, he rides the 45-meter long Blade, one of the fastest yachts in the world. But he has also shown a recent passion is Hollywood films. He co-produced Frank Miller\\u2019s Sin City: A Dame to Kill For and it has been announced that he is co-producing the directorial debut of 'The Avengers' and 'Lost in Translation' actor Scarlett Johansson, called Summer Crossing.    </p>    <p>     So how does he make his money from fast loans?    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     First move: Buying up Maltese near-zero tax scheme    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     In December 2011, Boyko bought 75 per cent of Latvian-based start-up AS 4Finance, which had subsidiaries at that time in Lithuania, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. According to documents obtained by     <a href=\\\"https://www.eic.network\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">      European Investigative Collaborations     </a>     , its eight Latvian shareholders ran the fast loans business through a Maltese company, Fatcat Investments Ltd.    </p>    <p>     Boyko offered 55 million Euro for AS 4finance. The first tranche of 12 million Euro boosted Fatcat's profits to 26 million Euro before taxes in 2011.    </p>    <p>     Should the 'Fat Cats' of Latvia worry about the taxman taking a large dollop of this cream?    </p>    <p>     Not if they are in Malta.    </p>    <p>     Due to the attractive tax rates in the nation of 450,000 people, Fatcat Investments paid only seven per cent in effective corporate tax - two million Euro. The EU average for corporate tax is about 22 per cent.    </p>    <p>     And this attractive regime continued into the next year, when Boyko's money came through once more.    </p>    <p>     In 2012, when Fatcat reached 43 million Euro in profits, the company paid only 366,762 Euro taxes on profits. This represents only 0.7 per cent.    </p>    <p>     So how does Malta favour the rich?    </p>    <p>     Malta charges companies at the highest rate of income tax - 35 per cent - on their profits. But if the company's activities and shareholders are mainly based abroad, they have a refundable tax credit mechanism that results in a reduced tax rate on income or gains that can go as low as five per cent.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed \\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/malta-files/public/img/articles/infographic-malta-tax.png\\\"/>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Additionally, in Malta there is no withholding tax on dividends, interests and royalties. And Maltese tax on capital gains for non-residents, which should include Boyko\\u2019s purchase of shares in 4finance, is a whopping zero per cent.    </p>    <p>     Boyko bought out the rest of the company in 2013. According to the signed financial statements for 2013, Fatcat Investment Limited (then called FCI) had 57 million Euro profits before taxation. But it paid only 512,501 Euro in taxes. An impressive 0.9 per cent.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Second move: Fast loans group lends cash to itself    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     4finance then embarked on a bizarre system of granting loans to its own companies, thus draining the profits of its European subsidiaries and centralising the cash flow in Malta.    </p>    <p>     In this way, 4finance Malta Ltd collected almost 68 million Euro in loan interests between 2013 and 2015 and shifted profits from other countries to the tax-friendly Mediterranean nation.    </p>    <p>     This is how it worked.    </p>    <p>     After his buy-out of 4finance in 2013, Boyko soon established full control over the group, liquidated FCI Investments, and now - with the assistance of two Latvians who were at the helm of Fatcat, Uldis Arnicans and Edgar Dupats - controls the whole group through a Cyprus company, Tirona Limited.    </p>    <p>     Boyko is not the official owner of Tirona Limited. The beneficial owner of 49 per cent is his 75 year-old relative, Vera, with the two Latvians Arnicans and Dupats taking equal parts of the remainder. These men are well-connected. In 2014, Dupats married the daughter of former Latvian prime minister Andris Skele, a local ex-oligarch with a reputation similar to Silvio Berlusconi. Arnicans is also connected with one of Skele\\u2019s family businesses.    </p>    <p>     But Boyko's elderly relative does not appear to be setting up her own lending group. According to a prospectus filed by 4finance to the Irish stock exchange in 2013 \\u201cTirona is part of Finstar Financial Group\\u201c which is \\u201cultimately beneficially owned by Mr. Oleg Boyko.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     The Russian billionaire restructured the fast loans empire, establishing a 4finance Holding S.A. in Luxembourg. From here, he started issuing bonds which financed its expansion.    </p>    <p>     In 2013, the Latvian subsidiary issued 170 million USD bonds on the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE), followed by its Luxembourg subsidiary on the bourses of Ireland, Stockholm and Frankfurt. Interest rates on this money, which Boyko's firm needed to pay back on his bonds, were between 11 and 13 per cent. These are a relatively high for bonds - but nowhere near the 700 per cent demanded of the firm's payday loan customers.    </p>    <p>     With this money, the billionaire expanded operations of 4finance to the Americas and the Caucasus. Because these 11 to 13 per cent rates were high, they demanded high interest rates in shareholder loans between the parent company and subsidiaries who were providing dozens of thousands of small loans in many countries.    </p>    <p>     A solution was found in Malta with its lax taxation system. 4finance S.A. Luxembourg branch founded its Maltese branch 4finance Malta Ltd in January 2013 and transferred the majority of the borrowed money to the new company.    </p>    <p>     Additionally, a 4finance group chart from April 2013 reveals that the Luxembourg company is providing loans to its affiliates in different countries and then attributing loan receivables to the Malta branch. In other words, to cover the costs of the interest rates from the bonds, Boyko's companies are lending money to themselves. These are called 'intercompany loans'.    </p>    <p>     Here is a reconstruction of the chart:    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed \\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/malta-files/public/img/articles/graphic_6.jpg\\\"/>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Many of these shareholders' intercompany loans given to local subsidiaries between 2013 and 2015 have 13.75 per cent or even 15 per cent annual interest rates.    </p>    <p>     This might be problematic if local tax authorities inspect the subsidiary, as these shareholder loans could be significantly higher than similar loans available on the local market. This could mean an unjustifiable transfer of money from a local subsidiary to a parent company.    </p>    <p>     Therefore, the Malta 4finance branch - without a single employee - managed to collect almost 68 million Euro of interest on intercompany loans between 2013 and 2015 from the 4finance subsidiaries of 21 countries.    </p>    <p>     A significant amount of interest was collected on 3 December 2015 by 4finance Malta and paid by many subsidiaries to the Luxembourg-based 4finance S.A. bank account opened at the Maltese-based IIG bank.    </p>    <p>     For 2013, the Malta Branch of 4finance paid only 12,774 Euro in taxes on a profit of 1.4 million Euro - 0.9 per cent.    </p>    <p>     Malta thus seems to be a suitable vehicle for a financial service where dozens of million of Euros of interest are funnelled from 4finance subsidiaries all over Europe and transferred to a Luxembourg parent company with next to zero taxes.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Third move: Exploiting the Native American Loophole    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Boyko then embarked on a new frontier - heading out west to take advantage of Americans in debt. In 2015, the US-based affiliate 4finance US Holding Inc, registered in the tax haven of Delaware, made a repayment on a loan worth 12 million dollars to the Malta branch of the same company.    </p>    <p>     Official operations of 4finance in the United States of America were started twelve days later, on 15 December 2015, through the subsidiary Zaplo.    </p>    <p>     However this is not the first time the company entered America. A few years previously, 4finance and Boyko\\u2019s Tirona Limited covertly provided finance through its intercompany loan scheme to fast cash operations run by Native American tribes in Montana and Wisconsin.    </p>    <p>     In 2013, the 4finance prospectus for the Irish Stock Exchange claimed it did not offer loans in the USA. But the prospectus did state that the group provided \\u201cmanagement services\\u201d and \\u201cadministration\\u201d to the United States fast loans company North Star Finance.    </p>    <p>     North Star Finance is owned by GVA Holdings LLC, part of the Fort Belknap Native American reservation community of Montana.    </p>    <p>     There is a barely concealed difference between the US operations of 'Native American-owned'     <a href=\\\"http://www.northcash.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">      www.northcash.com     </a>     , part of North Star Finance and the website of US-based 4finance subsidiary Zaplo.com, which started operations in December 2015.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed \\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/malta-files/public/img/articles/Boyko Story North Cash.jpg\\\"/>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed \\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/malta-files/public/img/articles/Boyko Story Zaplo.jpg\\\"/>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     This is also identical to the website fast loans company     <a href=\\\"http://www.lendgreen.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">      Lendgreen     </a>     .

Critics estimate his wealth at several billion Euro, the product of rampant corruption and cronyism in the Turkish state since his Justice and Development Party (AKP) took power in 2003.    </p>    <p>     But this lacks proof.    </p>    <p>     However a new investigation into the Erdo\\u011fan family business using papers from the #MaltaFiles collection, analysed by the European Investigative Collaboration Network (EIC), provides a rare insight into the secret business of the Erdo\\u011fans, and how Turkey\\u2019s ruling family exploit their position to enrich themselves.    </p>    <p>     Through offshore companies in the Isle of Man and Malta, the Erdo\\u011fans secretly own an oil tanker worth nearly 25 million USD called the Agdash.    </p>    <p>     The deal was constructed with Erdo\\u011fan's close friend and Turkish businessman, Sitki Ayan, and an Azeri-Turkish billionaire called M\\u00fcbariz Mansimov, owner of Istanbul-headquartered shipping conglomerate, Palmali Group. Documents show that since 2008, the cost of the Agdash deal for the two businessmen totals nearly 30 million USD, with seven million from Ayan, and nearly 23 million from Mansimov.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Turkey: A hidden kleptocracy    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     This secret deal occurs before Erdo\\u011fan\\u2019s recent spate of mass arrests of critics and closure of media houses. Back in 2008, the then-Turkish Prime Minister was still considered by the West and some in Turkey as a democratic reformer.    </p>    <p>     In July 2008, Erdo\\u011fan had just defended the most hardline attack on his rule: a prosecution for anti-secular activities against him and the AKP in the Turkish Constitutional Court. The Court ruled narrowly in his favour.    </p>    <p>     Shortly afterwards, his family was making money.    </p>    <p>     The Erdo\\u011fans obtained the Agdash from M\\u00fcbariz Mansimov in October 2008, using a company in the Isle of Man called Bumerz Limited \\u2013 named after its principal owners - the president\\u2019s son, Burak Erdo\\u011fan, his brother, Mustafa Erdo\\u011fan, and brother-in-law Ziya Ilgen.    </p>    <p>     Mansimov and the Erdo\\u011fans formed a business relationship over many years. Mansimov was born in the Azeri capital of Baku. He has served in the Soviet Army. After the collapse of the USSR, he entered the ship business, working for the state shipping company in Azerbaijan.    </p>    <p>     Later, he founded his own company, Palmali. Today, Mansimov owns almost 100 freighters. His empire controls around two thirds of the oil trade in the Black Sea region. The billionaire is considered well-connected. He is a friend of US President Donald Trump and was present at his inauguration in Washington DC in January this year.    </p>    <p>     When the 39-floors of residential and office block Trump Towers opened in Istanbul in 2009, Mansimov was the first customer - buying eight apartments, including the penthouse.    </p>    <p>     In 1998, Mansimov extended his operations to Turkey. Eight years later, he accepted Turkish citizenship and adopted a Turkish name, M\\u00fcbariz Gurbano\\u011flu - allegedly at Erdo\\u011fan's request.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cThe esteemed Prime Minister asked me, \\u2018Why don't you become a Turkish citizen?\\u2019\\u201d Mansimov said in an interview with Turkish media.

In March 2007, he opened a Malta company for the vessel, Pal Shipping Trader One.    </p>    <p>     In the same month, Erdo\\u011fan's brother-in-law, Ziya Ilgen, registered Bumerz Limited in the Isle of Man, a small Island in the Irish Sea that recently attempted to throw of its reputation as a tax haven.    </p>    <p>     Ilgen, a former teacher, rarely appears in public. But he is said to have managed Erdo\\u011fan\\u2019s business interests after he became prime minister in 2003.    </p>    <p>     United Shipping delivered the Agdash to Mansimov in the autumn of 2007. To help pay the bill for the construction, the Azeri arranged a loan of 18.4 million dollars from the Latvian bank, Parex, which for years was known to launder cash from corrupt figures from Eastern Europe and the ex-USSR.    </p>    <p>     The loan was never issued to Mansimov.    </p>    <p>     Instead, the Agdash spent a year sailing around the North Sea and Baltic Sea, visiting ports and oil terminals in the likes of Latvia, Netherlands and the UK. Meanwhile then-Prime Minister Erdo\\u011fan fended off threats from Turkey\\u2019s courts and military.    </p>    <p>     In October 2008, with Erdo\\u011fan's situation stabilised in Turkey, Bumerz Limited obtained 100 per cent of shares in the Agdash\\u2019s Maltese parent company, Pal Shipping Trader One for around 25 million dollars - the value of the ship when it was first built.    </p>    <p>     The family now owned its first oil tanker.    </p>    <p>     Documents from the Isle of Man company registry show that the day after the transfer, on 24 October 2008, Parex Bank finally issued the 18.4 million USD loan - to Bumerz. On some of documents for the financing, available on the public registry, Ziya Ilgen's name appears.    </p>    <p>     The Erdo\\u011fans, however, never paid a cent of the loan.    </p>    <p>     In a seven-year charter contract agreed that same day, Mansimov pledged to repay the Parex credit completely on behalf of the Erdo\\u011fans.    </p>    <p>     According to Maltese documents, the agreement, between Bumerz and Mansimov\\u2019s Palmali Shipping in the Caribbean, states that he would \\u201cpay as from the 1st to the 37th instalment to Parex Banka on behalf of Bumerz Limited as a charter hire of Pal Shipping Trader One Co Ltd or directly to Bumerz Limited\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     This means that the Agdash is essentially a gift from Mansimov. And from 2008 to October 2015, this gift cost him at least 21.2 million USD.    </p>    <p>     Here is the Mansimov deal in graphic form:    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed larger\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <a href=\\\"/malta-files/public/img/articles/infographic-price-of-friendship-EN.png\\\">      <img alt=\\\"\\\" class='\\\"larger\\\"' src=\\\"/malta-files/public/img/articles/infographic-price-of-friendship-EN.png\\\"/>     </a>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The remaining seven million dollars of the Agdash sale was paid by Erdogan's close friend Sitki Ayan - for reasons which are never explained.    </p>    <p>     For anyone familiar with Turkish political scandals, the Ayans make an unsurprising ally for the Erdo\\u011fans. In 2013, leaked conversations between Erdo\\u011fan and his son, Bilal, strongly hinted at the payment of bribes by the Ayans in return for state benefits.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Mansimov: Rising Fortunes Post-Deal    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     But what did Mansimov gain from this apparent deal? While there is no evidence of a direct quid pro quo from Erdo\\u011fan, there are many indications that Mansimov received the goodwill of the Turkish government after the trade, as his business in Turkey picked up significantly after 2008.    </p>    <p>     Today in Turkey, Mansimov is a business polymath, with interests in healthcare, energy, construction, tourism, airliners, and luxury cars.    </p>    <p>     The entrepreneur won a privatisation bid to develop a luxury port in the southwestern city of Bodrum, on the Mediterranean Sea. The port is known as the \\u201cbillionaire club\\u201d because of its attraction of celebrities and aristocrats such as Prince Charles and Bill Gates.    </p>    <p>     He holds shares in Tekfen, a Turkish construction company he bought with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) in 2008. Tefken is involved in high-value strategic projects, including the Baku-Tiflis-Ceyhan and Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas pipelines (TANAP) in Turkey. The TANAP contract is worth nearly half a billion dollars.    </p>    <p>     Mansimov is close to SOCAR. In 2007 and 2008, Palmali signed agreements with SOCAR to \\u201ctransport from the port of Ceyhan in Turkey, on an exclusive basis, all the crude oil\\u201d flowing from oil-rich Azerbaijan to Turkey through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline \\u201cfor a period of 10 years\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     The relationship between Mansimov, SOCAR and the Erdo\\u011fans is increasingly suspect, in light of research conducted by The Black Sea. Only a few months ago SOCAR secretly purchased five oil tankers from the Erdo\\u011fan family's other company, BMZ Group, using companies in Malta.    </p>    <p>     The sale took place in January 2017. That same month Erdo\\u011fan\\u2019s government effectively seized the management of SOCAR's gas operations in Turkey as part of its post-coup purge, and installed their own people at the helm.    </p>    <p>     For the two years before the sale, these tankers, like the Agdash, were rented by Mansimov's Palmali Group. Turkish media has alleged that the Azeri shipping magnate was paying off the loans for the five ships as part of a charter agreement, though no paper evidence has been uncovered.    </p>    <p>     Mansimov has proved useful in other ways. In 2015, the Turkish government turned to the billionaire for assistance during a diplomatic crisis with Iraq. Ankara was exporting unauthorised crude oil from the Kurdish Regional Government in Northern Iraq through Turkey's Ceyhan port on the Mediterranean Sea. This angered the Iraqi central Government. When Baghdad blacklisted the Turkish shipping company managing the exports, Mansimov stepped in to take over, with a Liberian Greek outfit that kept the Iraqi oil flowing out of Ceyhan.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Erdo\\u011fan Shipping: A Long Term Business    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The Erdo\\u011fans make every effort to obscure their ownership of the vessel. Although they contributed a seven million initial payment for the Agdash, the Ayans do not appear on the scene again for three more years. In 2011, The Erdogans pass the shares in Bumerz to another Isle of Man company set up by Sitki Ayan and his son, Bahattin, called Bellway Limited.    </p>    <p>     It appears that the Ayans - who declined to comment for the story - never really bought the Agdash. Secret and public documents obtained during the course of the Malta Files investigation reveal that despite the Ayans' names now beginning to appear on company documents, Ziya Ilgen still attested, on at least three occasions after, to remaining as the \\u201csole beneficial owner\\u201d of the Agdash. The documents authorise the Ayans to act on Ilgen's behalf. The latest of these was signed by Ilgen on August 2014, three years after the supposed transfer.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed \\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/malta-files/public/img/articles/signed-document.jpg\\\"/>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Erdo\\u011fan is often perceived as an Islamic ideologist in the West. A ruler with a mission to bring a non-radical, Sunni brand of Islam to the people of Turkey and their Muslim allies. He is viewed as radical and authoritarian, but a man of faith. The \\u201cMalta Files\\u201d demonstrates that family money is at least as important as political and religious convictions.    </p>    <p>     Today, the Agdash is moored in the Ellesmere Port on the west coast of the United Kingdom as a secret symbol of shady deals within the Turkish state.    </p>    <p>     Mansimov still rents the ship. After paying off the Parex loan in October 2015, he extended the contract with Bumerz for a further five years - increasing the total payments to date to nearly 23 million dollars. With the Ayan's Seven million, the total value of the Agdash deal is closer to 30 million.    </p>    <p>     By the time Mansimov's lease agreement ends in late 2020, he will have added yet a further five million dollars to the purses of the Erdo\\u011fan family - a friendship that costs over three thousand dollars a day.    </p>    <p>     We looked to confirm details of the above agreements with the concerned parties.

The process is designed to combat international money laundering, terrorism financing, organised crime and corruption.    </p>    <p>     For Credence and its Turkish clients, this corporate responsibility was too burdensome. it seems they wanted to answer as few questions as possible.    </p>    <p>     Credence\\u2019s Portfolio Manager, Georgina Kristic-Ficur, explained the problem to a senior partner, Andrew Cefai, an accountant by trade and treasurer of the Maltese-Spanish Chamber of Commerce:    </p>    <p>     \\u201cI have explored all the banks that we normaly [sic] bank with and it seems that the due diligence procedure in all of them became almost identical,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cFor that reason, it is very unlikely that we can open a bank account for Pal Shipping Trader One, to deposit their VAT cheques in the name of the company.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Why would an honest business be reluctant to supply the required evidence to a bank?    </p>    <p>     Kristic-Ficur explained further.

Much of Mansimov's business is located in Malta, where tax laws are friendly to the maritime industry.    </p>    <p>     The other is Sitki Ayan, a childhood chum of Erdo\\u011fan, who is close enough to call the President by his first name. Ayan was accused in 2013 of paying Erdo\\u011fan millions in bribes for a three billion USD \\u201cstate incentives\\u201d package on a pipeline deal.    </p>    <p>     In late November 2017, a political scandal erupted in Turkey prompted by the release of banking documents by the leader of the opposition party (CHP), Kemal K\\u0131l\\u0131\\u00e7daro\\u011flu. They appear to show 15 million USD in payments to members of the Erdo\\u011fan clan, including Ziya Ilgen, Mustafa and Ahmet Burak Erdo\\u011fan, the president's brother and eldest son, Osman Ketenci, father-in-law of Ahmet Burak, and Mustafa Gundogan, one of Erdo\\u011fan closest friends, said to have once been his private secretary.    </p>    <p>     These secret millions were transmitted from the Turkish HalkBank account of an Isle of Man shell company called Bellway Limited to the Erdogan clan over the course of several weeks in December 2011 and January 2012.    </p>    <p>     Bellway is the \\u2018ultimate controlling party\\u2019 of Pal Shipping Trader One, the 25 million USD Agdash oil tanker, and two other companies in the offshore structure: Bumerz Limited, also in the Isle of Man, and Bumerz Denizcilik in Istanbul.

She suggested to company partner Cefai that Credence use its own bank account to accept Pal Shipping\\u2019s cheques.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWe might even ask the bank to credit the amount to our account and authomatically [sic] transfer the funds to Pal-Shipping account abroad,\\u201d she added.    </p>    <p>     She would caution, however, that \\u201cthis procedure was not allowed in other banks\\u201d    </p>    <p>     The subsequent e-mail discussion between Cefai and Kristic-Ficur is not contained within EIC's files.

Cops found tens of millions in cash hidden in shoe boxes and inside safes.    </p>    <p>     The investigations were orchestrated by elements within the judiciary and police sympathetic to Fethullah G\\u00fclen, a Muslim preacher, now self-exiled in the US, who has been at war with Erdo\\u011fan for control of Turkey\\u2019s state institutions.    </p>    <p>     The police action was political. But the money was very real. Erdo\\u011fan and his AKP government faced an existential crisis.    </p>    <p>     The cash seized that day is linked to the Iran gold smuggling operation of businessman Reza Zarrab, who is currently giving evidence in the New York trial of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, assistant manager of Turkey's state-owned HalkBank, accused of \\u201corchestrating\\u201d the corrupt scheme.    </p>    <p>     Zarrab testified that he paid millions in bribes to top politicians to facilitate a criminal gold-for-oil deal with Iran though banks in Turkey.    </p>    <p>     While there is no direct evidence that Erdo\\u011fan benefited financially from this conspiracy, recordings of phone calls leaked online implicated him in other misdeeds. One tape in particular suggests that he organised bribes from Sitki Ayan though his son, Bilal.    </p>    <p>     Another leak a few days later was even more damning.    </p>    <p>     Several conversations allegedly taken on the day of the police raids, appear to show Erdo\\u011fan instructing his family, including his children, brother and \\u201cuncle Ziya\\u201d, to disappear tens of millions from the family safe.    </p>    <p>     These events were apparently of little concern to Credence.    </p>    <p>     Even with Turkey's corruption scandal headline news around the world, the Malta firm continued to administer Pal Shipping Trader One, even filing its annual accounts which detailed the strange deal with M\\u00fcbariz Mansimov and Palmali, and a group of offshore companies clearly linked to the Erdo\\u011fans.    </p>    <p>     Despite the suggestion that some of Turkey\\u2019s richest men were not only bribing Erdo\\u011fan, but hiding his money, Credence saw no problem in helping Pal Shipping open a new bank account when asked in 2015. Even though the request came from an employee of Sitki Ayan.    </p>    <p>     It was Credence who confirmed the existence of a bank account offshore. When responding to questions from The Black Sea about the status of the \\u201cclient account\\u201d, a representative said that Pal Shipping \\u201chas in fact opened an account with a Maltese credit institution\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Internal records confirm Credence charged 85 Euro for this service.    </p>    <p>     The admission that Pal Shipping secretly runs an offshore bank account in Malta is likely to create further scandal for the Erdo\\u011fans in Turkey, as opposition groups fight to prove the family is acting inappropriately, and have hidden assets offshore.    </p>    <p>     Credence did not disclose which bank holds the account, or if the proper due diligence was provided this time around.    </p>    <p>     By then the offshore paper trail had changed.    </p>    <p>     In late 2015, Ziya IIgen was no longer listed as a director of Pal Shipping, nor of the other Erdo\\u011fan companies which exist in Turkey and the Isle of Man.    </p>    <p>     Ilgen was replaced by Sitki Ayan's son, Bahaddin (aka Bahattin). Ilgen, however, was still involved in the business. Everyone appears to have been working on his behalf.    </p>    <p>     Credence opened the bank account at the request of another Turkish citizen, Yusuf Alapan.    </p>    <p>     Alapan was authorised to deal with Credence through a letter signed by Ilgen on 25 August 2014.    </p>    <p>     In this letter Alapan notes his address as the offices of Som Petrol, a petro-trading company which is part of Ayan\\u2019s ASB Group. Alapan, who described himself as a \\u201cBusiness Development Specialist\\u201d for ASB, was only the latest in a line of Ayan\\u2019s employees who dealt with Credence. All of whom were authorised in writing by Ilgen.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Erdo\\u011fan brother-in-law: Not \\u201cpolitically exposed\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     During the bank account discussions in October 2015, Alapan raises the issue of the service agreement between Credence and Pal Shipping.    </p>    <p>     He refers to a document signed by Ziya Ilgen on 14 November 2011 that permits Credence to act for the company in Malta.    </p>    <p>     A copy of this, obtained by EIC and The Black Sea, reveals further evidence that the Erdo\\u011fans were deliberately avoiding scrutiny - and that Ilgen appears to have broken EU and U.S. money laundering laws.    </p>    <p>     In short: Ilgen, the \\u201cultimate beneficial owner\\u201d of the Pal Shipping Trader One, declares himself not a 'Politically Exposed Person', also known as a 'PEP'.    </p>    <p>     In offshore parlance, a PEP is a term used to describe individuals at \\u201chigh risk\\u201d of being involved in corruption. The legal definition in Malta, and most of the rest of the world, includes \\u201cimmediate family members, or\\u2026 close associates\\u201d of senior government officials. In other words, people like Ilgen, the Erdo\\u011fans and perhaps even the Ayans.    </p>    <p>     Credence did not deny knowing Ilgen's connection to Turkey's first family, and told The Black Sea that they did not consider him - as a brother-in-law - politically exposed. Not that it matters. Credence's internal mechanisms, they said, \\u201cdo not peremptorily prohibit the on-boarding or servicing of customers who may be politically exposed persons but predicate the need for enhanced due diligence measures to be undertaken in such cases.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     U.S expert Burke Files disagrees.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cIt is not just family members, but close, and I add unrelated, natural persons can be PEPs,\\u201d he said. \\u201cTheir definition for a PEP is sorely dated and goes back to guidance I know to be stale and unhelpful.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     In fact, on his Credence service agreement, Ilgen lists his address as Gurgen Street in the Burhaniye Quarter on the Asian side of Istanbul. Though it does not mention a specific property, this is the location of the Erdo\\u011fan family home until he was elected prime minister in 2003.    </p>    <p>     Even if Credence did not know any of this, the structure of the Erdo\\u011fans\\u2019 business led to Bumerz Limited in Isle of Man, and then to Bumerz Denizcilik in Istanbul. At the time the family took over Pal Shipping in 2008, the whole operation was owned by Ziya Ilgen, Mustafa and Ahmet Burak Erdo\\u011fan, Ketenci and Gundogan.    </p>    <p>     These are the people who, a few weeks after Ilgen signed his service agreement in 2011, would allegedly receive 15 million USD from this structure, as revealed by the CHP last month.    </p>    <p>     Credence is not the only firm who helped the Erdo\\u011fans. Questions of due diligence surround Equiom, the \\u201cwell-established, international professional services provider\\u201d from the Isle of Man.    </p>    <p>     Since the beginning of 2011, the firm administered Bumerz Limited, where its employees sat as directors alongside Ziya Ilgen. A few months later, they would help Ayan establish Bellway Limited and work with Pal Shipping in Malta.    </p>    <p>     According to the CHP\\u2019s release, the firm received thousands from Bellway\\u2019s Turkish account at the the same time in in 2011 - likely fees for admin service.

This seems bad on paper. But check the small print. Because \\u00c7al\\u0131k's shareholders do not reside in Malta, nor does the company undertake significant activity on the Mediterranean islands, the company can apply for an 80 per cent refund, effectively creating a tax rate of only five per cent.    </p>    <p>     With the cash now in the EU, it can shift to accounts in Sweden.

In 2004, Berat married Erdo\\u011fan\\u2019s eldest daughter, Esra. Educated and connected, he became CEO of Turkish business giant \\u00c7al\\u0131k Holding in 2007, when he was only 29 years old, after working for the company since 1999. \\u00c7al\\u0131k's chairman, Ahmet \\u00c7al\\u0131k, is a close associate of Erdo\\u011fan and has ties to numerous foreign leaders.    </p>    <p>     From March 2007 until his departure for politics in 2013, Albayrak presided over a company that grew ever-closer to Erdogan\\u2019s government and ever richer, earning billions in public tenders.    </p>    <p>     A year following Albayrak\\u2019s promotion to CEO, \\u00c7al\\u0131k bought Sabah-ATV, Turkey\\u2019s second-biggest media company and owner of the Sabah daily newspaper, which had been seized by the government. \\u00c7al\\u0131k was the sole bidder for the tender, offering a 1.1 billion USD bid, which is said to have been financed by loans from two Turkish banks and Qatari investors, according to Turkish news reports.    </p>    <p>     Despite having no background or experience in politics, Albayrak has led the Turkish Energy Ministry since November 2015.

His speech adopted a serious tone.    </p>    <p>     From now on any Turkish businesses owning ships, yachts or sea vessels that flew foreign flags would be \\u201ctreated with suspicion\\u201d by the government, he said.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWe gave the [vessels] three months to change flags, free of charge,\\u201d Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m added, referring to the requests of his Ministry. \\u201cNow they have no excuse. If they insist on not changing to the Turkish flag, we don't see that [they have any] good intentions.\\u201c    </p>    <p>     The idea was to create a strong, national shipping fleet brandishing the Turkish colours and paying fees and taxes to the Turkish state.    </p>    <p>     Sat a few metres from Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m was his 30-year-old son, Erkam.    </p>    <p>     His son might have felt embarrassment at his father\\u2019s speech, since at that time he was the registered owner of least one general cargo ship called the \\u2018City\\u2019, through the family\\u2019s offshore company in the Netherland Antilles. This freighter flew not the Turkish flag, but that of the Dutch Caribbean Islands.    </p>    <p>     Since then, the family's ownership of foreign-flagged ships has grown, leading to the conclusion that Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m's speech was nothing less than hypocrisy.    </p>    <p>     An investigation into the Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m family enterprise, part of the European Investigative Collaborations\\u2019 (EIC) #MaltaFiles, reveals that the family currently sits on shipping and related assets of well over 100 million Euro.    </p>    <p>     This consists of eleven foreign-flagged ships nestled in a network of secretive companies in Malta, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands Antilles - specifically now Cura\\u00e7ao, with more suspected in the Marshall Islands and Panama.

These included Salih Zeki \\u00c7ak\\u0131r, a known ship-owner who employed Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m briefly before his career in Government, and Ahmet Erg\\u00fcn, President Erdogan\\u2019s advisor from his days as Istanbul Mayor, as well as a former MP and high court judge, Abbas G\\u00f6k\\u00e7e.    </p>    <p>     Their first vessel was the Silver Fish, a cheap twenty-year-old cargo ship, which was soon broken apart.    </p>    <p>     Over the course of the 2000s, the team built up other companies and bought other ships. These are now mostly broken up or sold. By 2009, when Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m delivered his impassioned speech promoting Turkish nationalism at the Ship Owners Association, the 4,000-tonne \\u2018City\\u2019 appears to be the only foreign asset. This was sold by Erkam two months later to their Panama company, North Bulkers S.A., before being broken up in 2011.    </p>    <p>     Since then the family\\u2019s shipping fortunes have acquired a formidable buying power. Six of the eleven ships identified by The Black Sea and EIC \\u2013 worth between 1.9 million and 33 million Euro - appear to have been bought without any bank loans. If so, this suggests an enormous cache of funds exists in the Dutch operation, despite on paper being a money-losing business.    </p>    <p>     The eleven ships are owned by offshore companies in the Netherlands and Malta, countries with attractive tax benefits for the maritime industry.    </p>    <p>     In February this year, Binali Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m \\u2013 as Prime Minister - visited Malta to sign a refugee agreement with the local government.    </p>    <p>     If he had been so inclined, he might have taken the short journey to visit the offices of Mifsud and Sons Ltd in the capital, Valletta, and the nearby town of St Julian's. This firm is owned by its namesake, Simon Mifsud, and represents the Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m family\\u2019s latest shipping outfits in the country, called Dertel Shipping Limited, Nova Ponza Limited, Rory Malta Limited and Nova Warrior Limited.    </p>    <p>     The Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131ms took over the new companies on 9 June 2016, a little over two weeks after Erdogan appointed Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m as Turkey\\u2019s Prime Minister.    </p>    <p>     The director of each of these is S\\u00fcleyman Vural, Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m\\u2019s nephew.    </p>    <p>     Inside three of these companies are three ships. These include the never-before revealed MV Shark, owned by Rory Malta Limited, the MV Ponza, by Nova Ponza Limited, and the MV Frezya S, registered to Nova Warrior Limited. Two of these, worth 1.9 million and two million, were obtained with the help of loans from the Swiss Corn\\u00e8r Bank.    </p>    <p>     Rory Malta and Nova Ponza lead to Ceren Dan\\u0131\\u015fmanl\\u0131k Denizcilik in Turkey, a shipping business set up by Uncle Yilmaz and his son, Rifat Emrah Erence, in Istanbul, at the end of 2015.    </p>    <p>     The shareholder of Dertel \\u2013 which does not own any ships - and Nova Warrior is a Dutch Caribbean offshore company called South Seas Shipping NV. On paper, it appears to be a dead end, leading to corporate law firm CMT Shipping NV, in Cura\\u00e7ao.    </p>    <p>     Corporate service providers such as CMT are often used as nominees by businesses and individuals wishing to hide their involvement.

Like with South Seas, company records in the Netherlands reveal Erkam as the man behind the new owner, and in charge of its 129.8 million USD assets.    </p>    <p>     Through Holland Investment Cooperatif UA, the company records show that family also owns 30 per cent of Q-Shipping BV based in Barendrecht. The partner in this venture is Abd\\u00fclvahit \\u015eim\\u015fek, a Turkish businessman who shares an office with the Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131ms in Istanbul.    </p>    <p>     Right now, Q-Shipping BV and its subsidiaries manage 20 ships - none of which sail under a Turkish flag.    </p>    <p>     Until last year, Zealand Shipping had ten ships flying the Dutch flag. In January 2016, a Turkish conglomerate close to the Erdogan government, Kolin Group, bought two of these vessels.    </p>    <p>     Today, Zealand Shipping and its subsidiaries still own eight vessels.    </p>    <p>     Every one of these boast names that display rampant Turkish nationalism - the Zealand Almere, MV Zealand Amsterdam and MV Zealand Rotterdam bought new in 2012 and 2013; the MV Zealand Ariane and MV Zealand Alexia, purchased second-hand throughout 2014; MV Zealand Beatrix, MV Zealand Delilah, MV Juliana bought new in 2010 and 2011.    </p>    <p>     The bill for these is not small. The Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Almere cost around 33 million Euro each to build. But Dutch records show that only the Amsterdam listed a debt, a loan of 33 million to the Kuveyt T\\u00fcrk Bank, a non-interest, Islamic financial institution part-owned by the Turkish government though the Directorate General of Foundations, whose director sits on the bank\\u2019s board.    </p>    <p>     Another loan taken out by Zealand is for the Juliana, a dry bulk carrier, which was financed by a 17.16 million Euros from the Yap\\u0131 ve Kredi Bank in Turkey.    </p>    <p>     In total, three of the ships were constructed by Sefine, a shipbuilder close to Binali Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m. Sefine was run until 2014 by Suat Hayri Aka, when he was forced by Turkish law to transfer his shares to his brother in order to to accept a government job.    </p>    <p>     What was this position? Undersecretary to the Ministry of Transport. This made him the deputy of Binali Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m.    </p>    <p>     But rules do not always apply to friends. Despite clear conflicts of interest rules on public entities, the Ministry continued to conduct business with Sefine, likely violating laws in the process.    </p>    <p>     It is not the only act of generosity towards Sefine by Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m. In 2010, the year Sefine began constructing Zealand\\u2019s ships, Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m brokered the sale of half of the company\\u2019s shares to Kolin to save it from financial ruin.    </p>    <p>     After Turkey's constitutional referendum last month, which granted President Erdogan the power to destroy the Prime Ministry in two years, Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m's tenure at the top is coming to an end.    </p>    <p>     But in the nearly twenty years since he \\u201ctransferred his businesses\\u201d to his children, they have created a soft cushion for him to land upon when he leaves politics for good.    </p>    <p>     The Black Sea approached several relevant parties named in the story with unanswered questions.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><footer> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-sm-12\\\">    <p>     If you have more information on this story please send an email to     <a href=\\\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2755444e4d67554e5442525709494253\\\">      <span class=\\\"__cf_email__\\\" data-cfemail=\\\"1466777d7e54667d677161643a7a7160\\\">       [email\\u00a0protected]      </span>     </a>     (pgp: 0x8234F8D4A624D9F4).    </p>    <p>     This article was developed with the support of     <a href=\\\"http://journalismfund.eu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">      <img alt=\\\"Journalism Funds FoX Grant\\\" class=\\\"journalismfund\\\" src=\\\"/malta-files/public/img/journalismfundlogo.png\\\"/>     </a>    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></footer>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"4eb9c590-7fe4-41b7-9dd7-1501bf9d21ff\"}]"}, "pk": 2006, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Ilgen is also a shareholder in BMZ, which sold the ships to SOCAR.    </p>    <p>     This chain of links also returns to Palmali Group, run by M\\u00fcbariz Mansimov - the billionaire Azeri oil shipping tycoon who sold an oil tanker to the Erdo\\u011fan family's offshore company in 2008. Various Turkish trade media reported in March that that SOCAR had purchased seven oil tankers from Palmali Group to increase its maritime operations.    </p>    <p>     SOCAR and Palmali remained silent about the deal, refusing to answer our questions on the value of the purchases or whether the Erdo\\u011fans\\u2019 five ships were among those sold.    </p>    <p>     Fate of the ships: rental via Moscow    </p>    <p>     So what happened to the five ships that the Azeri state company bought from the Erdo\\u011fan family earlier this year?    </p>    <p>     At the present time, SOCAR rents the ships to a Moscow-based firm called Frachtmortrans.    </p>    <p>     SOCAR would not respond to inquiries about who owns Frachtmortrans. Two of the men listed on the company documents are in the oil business in Azerbaijan.    </p>    <p>     The first is Namik Aladdin Ogly Kadyrov, more commonly known as Namik Gadirov, and formerly the head of operations at SOCAR Logistics in Dubai, but who now appears to run a small maritime operation in Switzerland opened in March this year.    </p>    <p>     The second is Gashim Mirza Ogly Movsumzade - or Ashim Movsumzade - an Azeri who claims to be the long-time representative of BP International in Azerbaijan.    </p>    <p>     David H Nicholas, head of BP International\\u2019s press office in London, told The Black Sea that \\u201c[Movsumzade] has acted as an agent or representative for some of BP\\u2019s oil and petroleum trading activities in Azerbaijan and the Caspian region,\\u201d but that it was a \\u201cpart time role for which, as an independent contractor, he was paid a retainer \\u2013 he has never been an employee of BP.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Nicholas stated that he could not find any \\u201cBP connection to or information on [Frachtmortrans], and so cannot comment on it\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Neither Movsumzade nor Gadirov responded to The Black Sea\\u2019s attempts to contact them.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><footer> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-sm-12\\\">    <p>     If you have more information on this story please send an email to     <a href=\\\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a9dbcac0c3e9dbc0daccdcd987c7ccdd\\\">      <span class=\\\"__cf_email__\\\" data-cfemail=\\\"bdcfded4d7fdcfd4ced8c8cd93d3d8c9\\\">       [email\\u00a0protected]      </span>     </a>     (pgp: 0x8234F8D4A624D9F4).    </p>    <p>     This article was developed with the support of     <a href=\\\"http://journalismfund.eu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">      <img alt=\\\"Journalism Funds FoX Grant\\\" class=\\\"journalismfund\\\" src=\\\"/malta-files/public/img/journalismfundlogo.png\\\"/>     </a>    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></footer>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"9e4361e2-4d92-47d0-9f0c-f56213aba66d\"}]"}, "pk": 2007, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Previously, he was Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication, and has been one of the strongest and most loyal allies of the President.    </p>    <p>     In Pendik, a working-class neighbourhood on the Asian side of Istanbul near the Sabiha G\\u00f6k\\u00e7en International Airport, a new mosque is under construction.    </p>    <p>     Due to be delivered this summer, the mosque will stand as a testament to the rule of the AKP, which controls most of the municipality's assembly.    </p>    <p>     Erdogan has overseen a massive construction boom in mosques across Turkey and in 30 mega-mosque projects     <a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1211&amp;recType=story\\\">      across five continents     </a>     , which are part of a strategy to gain influence in foreign Islamic communities.    </p>    <p>     The project was announced by local AKP's Meclis Uyesi - Assembly Members - back in 2014 after the municipality received a 1.75 million Turkish Lira donation - 600,000 Euro at the time - from a mysterious company: Elia Spa Kozmetik AS.    </p>    <p>     The secret benefactors demanded two conditions: For the money must be spent on a mosque and for the name to be Amine Hatun - \\u201cLady Amine\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Under Turkish law, any donations with conditions require a vote in the local assembly. In the staunchly-AKP Pendik, however, these are formalities. Within a day, the vote cleared the assembly.    </p>    <p>     This vote passed in the face of complaints from the opposition Republican Peoples Party member, Tarik Balyali, who voiced concerns about the source of the cash.    </p>    <p>     Despite his protestations, the leaders of the assembly gave him no reply.    </p>    <p>     Balyali, who was elected as a CHP local assembly member in 2009, told The Black Sea that, \\u201cthe amount donated was unprecedented. I never seen anyone donate such a high amount; it just never happens.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     \\u201cI found it very strange and looked into it,\\u201d he added, \\u201cbut could never find out find who was behind the donation.

And he was the attorney of Elia Spa Kozmetik, who brokered the deal on the company\\u2019s behalf.    </p>    <p>     Bayram is a well-connected lawyer. He happens to represent the Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131ms, and is a family friend. Last year, he was also elected as a member of the Turkish parliament for the AKP.    </p>    <p>     The company that owned Elia Spa, Neshatech BV, is listed to an office in Almere, Netherlands. In its short life, the firm never undertook any apparent business.    </p>    <p>     It seems the purpose of its existence was to help transfer the mosque cash into Turkey, and hide the name of the real owner, Erkam Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m, the son of Prime Minister Binali Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m.    </p>    <p>     Over the next year, the Pendik municipality drew up the plans for an opulent mosque before announcing the public tender in 2015. During that time, the costs of the project inflated significantly the original donation amount of 1.75 million to 5.72 million liras [1.42 million Euro under today's exchange rate]. The rest of the cash for the construction will not come from such donors. Its source is the Pendik municipality's budget, funded by the local voters.    </p>    <p>     This means public money now subsidises a lavish mosque financed by the Prime Minister's family.    </p>    <p>     Originally, the winning bid was awarded to a private contractor from Istanbul. Then suddenly it wasn\\u2019t.    </p>    <p>     Shortly after the construction began, for reasons unknown, the mosque contract shifted quietly to the Pendik municipality\\u2019s own private company, Penyapsan A.S.    </p>    <p>     The move, without any public announcement, is in breach of Turkish law, which states that municipality companies \\u201ccannot be awarded tenders in their own jurisdictions if there are elected officials residing in the company board.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     But Penyapsan\\u2019s board is packed with AKP elected officials and \\u201cappointees\\u201d, such as company president, Remzi \\u015eeker, and board members Ekrem Y\\u0131ld\\u0131r\\u0131m and \\u00d6znur Canayakin.

The \\u2018Islamist\\u2019 Libya Dawn militia alliance seized the capital Tripoli, and most of the country's northwest.    </p>    <p>     The elected Government remains in exile in the east city of Tobruk, defended by the Libyan National Army (LNA) and backed by Russia, Egypt and the UAE.    </p>    <p>     In 2015, billionaire Libyan oil magnate and TV media owner Hassan Tatanaki hires Ocampo on a three-year contract worth a million dollars a year, plus a daily wage of 5,000 dollars. The job? To help him promote his \\u2018Justice First\\u2019 initiative, designed to bring \\u201cpeace to Libya\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Tatanaki has some powerful allies. He has called General Khalifa Haftar, head of the Libyan National Army, a \\u201cpartner\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Six days after the launch of Justice First, on 12 May 2015, Fatou Bensouda, Ocampo\\u2019s successor as ICC's chief prosecutor, briefs the United Nations Security Council that she is \\u201cconcerned\\u201d that the Libyan National Army attacks densely populated areas, causes high civilians deaths, and tortures prisoners.    </p>    <p>     That month, on one of Tatanaki\\u2019s television stations, a commander in the Libyan National Air Force states he will kill anyone who does not join his military offensive. He adds that: those people are traitors who have to be slaughtered, and their wives must be raped before their eyes. Ocampo finds out this information from an international cooperation adviser at the ICC.    </p>    <p>     Meanwhile, Ocampo reaps the rewards of his million-dollar a year contract to advise a client, Tatanaki, who was publicly and privately supported a militia accused of war crimes and incitement to war crimes - members of which risk indictment by the International Criminal Court.    </p>    <p>     At the stage, Ocampo does not denounce Tatanaki, nor does he terminate the contract in protest. Instead, he decides to protect his client against ICC prosecution, imply the leaked emails.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo sends an email to Tatanaki's assistant on the issue of the senior soldier's incendiary statements: \\u201cThe Commander should not say that. We should discuss how to prevent that\\u2026 the channel should not promote that\\u2026 We need now a strategy to isolate [Ocampo's client] Hassan [Tatanaki].\\u201d    </p>    <p>     In the next few days Ocampo and Tatanaki\\u2019s assistant work out measures that should secure the legal positions of the military leaders, and especially Tatanaki. Later he writes to Tatanaki\\u2019s assistant again: \\u201cI would suggest to develop a comprehensive plan to ensure that Hassan and the forces he is supporting are not the target of ICC prosecutions.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Ocampo slowly realises that Tatanaki wants peace only if it means that he and General Haftar are the ones to enforce it.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cHassan is too much to one side and I don\\u2019t think he will be able to go up and have a more inclusive approach. That makes me very uncomfortable,\\u201d he writes to an American acquaintance who advises him in the work for his Libyan client.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cHe has a lot of enemies and [their number is] growing. The problem is that is his policy.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Still, this is not enough to say goodbye to his paymaster.    </p>    <p>     On social media in recent years, videos appeared showing Haftar\\u2019s troops executing suspected terrorists. Last month, the ICC, upon Bensouda\\u2019s request, issued an arrest warrant for one of Haftar\\u2019s commanders, Mahmoud al-Werfall, who is being sought for multiple murders in 2016 and 2017.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     How does Ocampo respond to his actions?    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     When interviewed by EIC partner Der Spiegel this week, Luis Moreno Ocampo says he thought working with Hassan Tatanaki was a good idea.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cHe told me he was trying to fix Libya,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhat he was proposing to me was absolutely not just legal, it was positive.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Ocampo says he warned his client against cooperating with General Haftar.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cIt is obvious that General Haftar and his people also commit crimes\\u2026 I told Mr Tatanaki \\u2018Look, Mr. Tatanaki, the problem here is every side commits crimes.

The governing document, for the first time, recognised the autonomy of the KRG - which has existed since the early 1990s - and codified its people\\u2019s right to a share of Iraq\\u2019s vast oil reserves.    </p>    <p>     For Kurds, the new legal standing was some restitution for years of persecution and near-genocidal aggression under Saddam Hussein.    </p>    <p>     For over ten years, the billions generated from international crude sales - much     <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/10/corruption-scandals-destabilise-iraqi-kurdistan\\\">      allegedly squirreled     </a>     away due to corruption - has formed the basis for the KRG\\u2019s bid for independence, a move Baghdad tried to stifle.    </p>    <p>     But Ankara\\u2019s support was crucial.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Erdogan\\u2019s son-in-law: Key to Kurdish oil deals    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The Turkish government\\u2019s secretive oil deals with the KRG started in 2011, when Turkey granted a newly formed company, PowerTrans, the sole licence to transport Northern Iraqi oil through its pipelines.    </p>    <p>     It was a lucrative deal. So it was unsurprising when it emerged that PowerTrans was run by Erdogan\\u2019s son-in-law, Berat Albayrak, then CEO of \\u00c7al\\u0131k Holding, a giant Turkish conglomerate.    </p>    <p>     Over the next few years, Turkey struck further pacts with the KRG. In May 2012, the two countries made headlines after it was revealed they had signed a secret direct pipeline deal - again without the approval of the Iraqi government.    </p>    <p>     For Baghdad, already angry over the \\u201cillegal\\u201d PowerTrans exports, this 2012 contract was a redline. It retaliated by stopping the wages to Northern Iraqi workers. Fortunately for the Kurds, Erdo\\u011fan stepped in and reputedly provided two billion USD in emergency loans, allowing the KRG to pay its workers and keep the lights on.    </p>    <p>     A second redline for Iraq was crossed a year later. Erdogan and Barzani signed a multi-billion-dollar contract granting Turkey access to 13 more oil fields, half of which were in cooperation with the U.S. energy giant, Exxon Mobil.    </p>    <p>     The arrangement allowed for up to a million barrels per day to flow out of Northern Iraq though a recently constructed Kurdish pipeline. Turkey was entitled to buy and resell half of it.    </p>    <p>     Ankara provided Erbil with an account at the Turkish state-owned Halkbank, to accept deposits on the new contract. In an attempt to appease Baghdad, both the Turks and the Kurds claimed the cash would remain in Halkbank\\u2019s vault, untouched, until a revenue-sharing agreement could be worked out between the Kurds and a furious Iraqi Government.    </p>    <p>     In May 2014, KRG announced that \\u201cfive percent of the sales revenue will be set aside in a separate account for reparations\\u201d for Baghdad.    </p>    <p>     The Iraqi government responded drastically, issuing a notice to crude traders, warning that any entity purchasing Kurdish oil was breaking the law and engaged in \\u201csmuggling\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     It also lodged complaints against the KRG and Turkey in international arbitration courts in Paris and London, arguing that the sales were a breach of sovereignty.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed \\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/stories/public/img/articles/erdogan-and-the-kurds/3oil-pipeline.jpg\\\"/>    </div>    <div class=\\\"caption\\\">     <p>      How Iraqi Kurdish oil gets to market: the Kirkuk-Ceyhan Pipeline     </p>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Turkish fear: Kurdish oil trade will shift to Iran    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     By 2015, the KRG was feeling the squeeze. As crude oil prices hit their lowest in over a decade, the Iraqi government opted to further punish the Kurds for circumventing Baghdad\\u2019s authority with private oil deals by ordering the closure of the Kirkuk oil pipeline.    </p>    <p>     It had also blacklisted the Turkish transportation company responsible for shipping the oil to the international market. Ankara had found a quick fix for this.

He remained in close contact with his old company, however, as his leaked emails reveal.    </p>    <p>     In August 2015, PowerTrans\\u2019s Iraq country manager, Dursun Ali Isguzar, raised concerns that the Kurdish President Masoud Barzani's tenure might soon come to an end: \\u201cIf Barzani leaves office, the region will be highly affected,\\u201d Albayrak\\u2019s former colleague wrote. \\u201cTrade with Turkey will decline.

Baghdad\\u2019s legal actions, he said, left Erbil unable to sell its oil on the open market, meaning it had only a \\u201climited number of buyers\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     These traders, he said, were forced to sign \\u2018Special Purchase Agreements\\u2019, from whom the \\u201cKRG receives a hefty lump sum before it [delivers] the petrol.\\u201d This had generated over a billion dollars for the Kurds.    </p>    <p>     The Iraqis, however, had squeezed the pipelines, reducing the KRG\\u2019s daily oil output by a quarter, from 600k per day to 450k, and therefore unable to deliver the billions worth of oil for which it had already been paid.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cIt is rumoured,\\u201d Yazar told Albayrak, \\u201cthat the KRG has debts of $15bn to various circles. And that approx. $3-5bn amount of this is owed to crude petrol buyers\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Indeed, the Kurds were in financial trouble.    </p>    <p>     The day after, KRG Minister of Natural Resources, Ashti Hawrami, sent Albayrak - and the Turkish state - an offer.    </p>    <p>     In a document marked \\u2018Strictly Private and Confidential\\u2019, he first explains how the \\u201c[Turkish and KRG] cooperation, among other things, has paved the way for KRG\\u2019s independent oil exports to the international market\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     The destabilising effects of Baghdad, ISIS attacks and falling oil prices, however, caused \\u201cfinancial difficulties\\u201d for the KRG.    </p>    <p>     Although Ankara had already bailed out the Kurds with loans, he writes, \\u201cthe KRG now needs further financial assistance from the Turkish Side\\u201d to pay its bills. Hawrami asks for 3.74 billion USD. Although he presents several proposals, the KRG\\u2019s \\u201cpreference\\u201d is to sell the Turks a significant interest in several Kurdish oil and gas fields - at greatly discounted prices - as well as guaranteeing the Turks will receive a minimum level of financial returns.    </p>    <p>     The outcome of these discussion is not documented in the leak. Nor did the KRG, Hawrami, or Albiayrak respond to our requests for clarification.    </p>    <p>     Nevertheless, the Turks continued to facilitate the sale of the Kurds\\u2019 oil to a small group of traders, even if it has created problems in Baghdad.    </p>    <p>     A week after KRG President Barzani announced the date for the referendum, in June, an oil tanker carrying over 700,000 barrels of Kurdish crude left the southern Turkish port of Ceyhan - a major oil terminal which links to the Kirkuk pipeline.    </p>    <p>     After a legal complaint from the Iraqi Government, a Canadian court ordered seizure of the oil tanker. Yet, four days after the referendum, another Canadian company announced an oil sales agreement with the KRG.    </p>    <p>     For now, the oil still flows - and so far Ankara\\u2019s sanctions are more talk than action. Though Turkey censored Kurdish TV channels and cancelled direct flights to the Iraqi Kurdish region, the border and the pipeline remain open.    </p>    <p>     Kurdistan\\u2019s rattled neighbour to the north is now trying to walk back years of pre-referendum deals dating as far back as 2011.    </p>    <p>     In hindsight, this cheap oil, negotiated behind closed doors, might be more expensive than Turkey could ever have imagined.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     <span class=\\\"disclaimer\\\">      Photos: Shutterstock, Turkish Presidency, Wikimedia Commons (graphic)     </span>    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Follow The Black Sea    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     <p align=\\\"center\\\">      <a href=\\\"https://facebook.com/TheBlackSeaEU/\\\">       <img src=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/public/img/icons/icon-fb.svg\\\"/>      </a>      <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/TheBlackSeaEU/\\\">       <img src=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/public/img/icons/icon-twitter.svg\\\"/>      </a>     </p>    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"789bf27f-cbf7-40ab-b595-ea086b36eff0\"}]"}, "pk": 2016, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

The dark earth of the flat fields is churned for the planting season, and retreats into the horizon of mist. As our car moves through the farmland, crows take to the air, glide in the breeze, return to the field, and strut across the ground, searching for more seeds to thieve.    </p>    <p>     We pass v-shaped irrigation channels, their concrete sidings thick with weeds, and strewn with yoghurt tubs, tissues and crushed cans and plastic bottles of beer.    </p>    <p>     Turning off this country road in Dolj county, southwest Romania, onto a dirt track, we enter an expanse of pasture. Straying in and out of the fog are sheep, heavy with winter fleece, and patrolled by thin black dogs. We drive alongside an empty concrete tower to a sheepfold with a green tarpaulin roof, overlaid with branches. In front is a wooden shack, piled with stacks of hay, where a filthy white sheepdog sleeps with a loose chain around its neck.    </p>    <p>     At the back of the hut, hens wander free from their enclosure.

He claimed his actions saved a young woman\\u2019s life     </span>    </p>    <p>     <br/>     One evening in 2003, a pensioner Petre Toma was driving his wagon through the southwest Romanian village of Marotinu de Sus, his hands slack on the reins as the horse trotted forward. But the 76 year-old had been drinking, says his neighbour Mircea Mitrica, and was so intoxicated that he tumbled off the wagon and onto the road. The horse stepped on Toma\\u2019s head and chest, and killed its master.    </p>    <p>     Toma\\u2019s family buried him in the local cemetery at the edge of town. A few weeks later, the deceased\\u2019s nephew, Gheorghe Marinescu, called Mitrica to his house to meet his father-in-law and drink a glass of plum brandy tuica.    </p>    <p>     But this was not a fraternal toast to mourn the passing of a relative. When inside, Marinescu showed Mitrica how his wife had fallen seriously ill with an unknown condition.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cShe was talking to herself, shouting: \\u2018He\\u2019s on top of me! He\\u2019s eating me! He\\u2019s killing me!\\u2019 She couldn\\u2019t stand on her feet,\\u201d says Mitrica. \\u201cShe had lost a lot of weight. But that young woman was suffering from no disease.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cSo her husband and her father asked me what I could do to save her. She had two baby daughters, and it would have been a shame for their mother to die so young.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Marinescu gathered three other men to his house, and the six of them talked and drank until midnight, when they agreed on a diagnosis: a restless spirit from the afterlife - known as a moroi - was possessing the woman, crushing her body and draining her lifeforce.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWhen people die, they can transform into a moroi,\\u201d says Mitrica. \\u201cWe realized that Toma Petre had turned into a moroi, had attacked the young woman, and was sucking her blood. We had to do something or she would soon be dead.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     The men did not call the local Orthodox priest to perform an exorcism. \\u201cIf the priest would have known, he would have had to tell the authorities and get a permit,\\u201d says Mitrica. The shepherd believes that this includes an approval from the church and the local Government for such a ritual. \\u201cBut by the time the permit arrived the woman could have been dead. Or maybe the priest would have said no, or the city hall and the police would have said no.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Mitrica believed only he knew the correct treatment.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cI said: \\u2018let\\u2019s go to the cemetery\\u201d.

His face was red, and his beard had started to grow. At the corner of his mouth was fresh blood. I cut into the chest with a pitchfork, and opened the ribcage. Inside his body was a pool of blood. As we pulled out the heart, it was still beating. That\\u2019s when we knew he was a moroi.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Mitrica put the heart in a plastic bag, and says he laid the body in the coffin, and covered the remains with earth. But some villagers who we speak to claim that Mitrica and his gang did not put back the corpse with care, and left the remains in a filthy state.    </p>    <p>     A local ritual dictated that the men should take the heart to a crossroads. This is a place where the worlds of the living and dead meet or clash. Here they wanted to break the Moroi\\u2019s curse on the woman. At a junction of two roads, the men arranged a bonfire, lit the branches, and as it burned, Mitrica held up the heart on the pitchfork, and singed the tissue of the organ.    </p>    <p>     Returning to the village, they built a second fire in the court of the young woman\\u2019s house.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWe cooked the heart, burnt it into ashes, boiled some water, made a tea out of the ashes, and gave it to the sick woman to drink.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Each of the six men then returned home to their houses and their wives.    </p>    <p>     The next day the young victim of the sickness arrived at Mitrica\\u2019s house. She could walk, and could talk freely, and told him to come to her place to eat, drink and celebrate her sudden recovery.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cShe was healthy again,\\u201d says Mitrica.    </p>    <p>     But the police discovered what happened during the night. They found the body, examined the remains, saw the ribcage was broken and the heart had been stolen.    </p>    <p>     Mitrica was afraid, so ran away to the woods to hide in his sheepfold.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     \\u201cIt was a good deed - we saved a life\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     But the cops caught up with Mitrica.

Toma Petre would have eaten the woman. She came back to life after she drank tea made from the heart of the moroi.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     In the village of Marotinu de Sus, residents claim that between the 1970s and 1990s, they often feared that when a villager died, a Moroi was possessing the living. It was common to dig up the bodies of the dead and cut out their organs to save a life. But since 2004, there has been no public case.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cThere is a new ritual here,\\u201d Mitrica says, \\u201cto take a knitting needle and stick it through a dead man\\u2019s heart to make sure he will not turn into a moroi.

The roads are clean and straight and on an early November afternoon, there is no traffic. The villages are full of one-level houses from the first half of the century with classical motifs of columns, pediments and cornices - a miniature pastiche of an aristocratic mansion. But their paint is peeling, the concrete fences are crumbling, and on some buildings the roof has fallen in, and the place is abandoned. As we pass through one village, nobody is walking the streets, except an old woman in a black headscarf limping at the edge of the road, talking to herself.    </p>    <p>     Moving through a larger town, we see two large women in their fifties, both wearing bathrobes, and waving at every car, asking to hitch a ride. There is one shop in a new two-floor building of naked concrete, with a single door and no sign. Outside a teenage girl is sitting bareback on a horse, her head bowed as she checks her telephone.    </p>    <p>     In a small valley, we drive into the town of Bulzesti, known as a village of stories. Here there is a legend that 200 years ago, a part of the village called Gura Racului was possessed by the spirits of a demon, known as a strigoi. To escape the curse, the residents dismantled all their houses, and moved them to another part of the hill.    </p>    <p>     Myths are sketchy in Romania, and monsters have multiple names and overlapping qualities. To many, the strigoi are the undead who walk at night, bringing together the spirits of the zombie and the vampire. Meanwhile the moroi are creatures who stay stationary in the coffins after death, but infect the living with their spirit. Some folk literature states the moroi died in tragic circumstances, such as children who were never baptised, suffocated in their swaddling clothes, or drowned in a pig\\u2019s trough. These dead children haunt their parents by sitting on their chest at night, and stopping them from breathing.    </p>    <p>     But there is no agreement on what actually is a moroi or a strigoi, because Romania is a large country with a strong oral culture, where there has been little communication between its extremities, its neighbouring counties, or even villages on the same stretch of road.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     \\u201cMythologies and rituals are different from one village to the next\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Bogdan Halic is a doctor of history and specialist in the medieval age at the National School of Political and Administrative Studies (SNSPA) in Bucharest.

But the location appears on Google Maps. On our phones, the app's blue dot flashes below its place name. This is a street of detached farmhouses. Only one resident is here - a man in his sixties in a flat cap and walking stick. We ask him if this is Gura Racului, and he tells us this is Bulzesti, and Gura Racului is in a different place, a strip of 15 houses two kilometres away, and set against the side of a hill.    </p>    <p>     The ghost village has tricked Google.    </p>    <p>     In front of the row of houses is an orchard of apple trees, their branches damp from the dew of the mist. Cows move between the trees. Behind them lies a dried-out canal and a bridge, where a man in his seventies is sitting on a stool in brown slacks and a loose jacket, overseeing the herd. His name is Marin, and he smiles with a gold molar on the right side of his mouth.    </p>    <p>     <br/>    </p>    <p>     We ask Marin: \\u201cIs this village Gura Racului?\\u201d    </p>    <p>     \\u201cYes,\\u201d he says, \\u201cbut actually this village is known by the name of Natarai.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     <br/>    </p>    <p>     Natarai is not a normal name for a village.    </p>    <p>     But neither is Gura Racului, as you can see below, where we translate these two place names into English.    </p>    <p>     <br/>    </p>    <p>     We ask Marin: \\u201cIs this village the Mouth of the Crab?\\u201d    </p>    <p>     \\u201cYes,\\u201d he says, \\u201cbut actually it is known by the name: the Village of the Imbeciles.\\u201d    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed \\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/stories/public/img/articles/exorcism-romanian-style/3.jpg\\\"/>    </div>    <div class=\\\"caption\\\">     <p>      If you lie in front of a judge, you risk a haunting from a Moroi - says cowherd Marin, Gura Racului     </p>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     \\u201cDo you believe in moroi?\\u201d we ask the cowherd.    </p>    <p>     He laughs.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cI believe in nothing.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     But Marin goes on to elaborate how the myth of the moroi manifests itself in the Village of the Imbeciles.    </p>    <p>     The most important asset to anyone in the village is land. Neighbours argue over the border of where one strip of farmland ends and the other begins. When they do not get their way, the neighbours curse each other. If this still does not resolve the dispute, they go to court. But here truth is relative to an individual\\u2019s needs. Not all deeds are written down. Not all plots are accurately mapped out. Therefore, in front of a magistrate, plaintiffs will often lie.    </p>    <p>     A farmer loses his rightful claim to another who gave false testimony in court. If the honest farmer dies, his mendacious rival will become possessed by the spirit of the dead man he wronged.    </p>    <p>     Therefore the legend of the moroi has today become a curse that haunts the living - if they lie before a judge.    </p>    <p>     The solution to resolving the problem is similar to the techniques used in the community in Marotinu de Sus, 60 kilometres away.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cThe villagers would dig up the bodies of the newly dead, take out the liver and the heart, grill them and give them to the people who were sick,\\u201d says Marin. \\u201cThen they burnt the body of the dead man.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     We ask the cowherd whether he knows about the moroi... or the strigoi... of Gura Racului, and whether the town was moved because of a haunting. He says this is not true, as the people from a nearby village of Dobretu wanted more land for their children\\u2019s houses, so they built on the plot which became Gura Racului.    </p>    <p>     But when we ask for more proof of what he says, he adds: \\u201cNot much is known. There are no more elders who know.\\u201d    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     \\u201cWe gathered the crosses together - and made a bonfire\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     We try and find someone even older than Marin. Outside a smallholding of goats and chickens we discover eighty year-old Golica Papusa, who has no front teeth, and lives alone with his animals.    </p>    <p>     Golica never stabbed a corpse in the heart, but he says that moroi-killing in the village was not just a tradition, but a     <span style=\\\"font-style:italic;\\\">      business     </span>     .    </p>    <p>     \\u201cI knew a man who was cutting up dead people,\\u201d says Golica. \\u201cHe was three or four years older than me. So he was telling me that he was digging up the bodies and cutting and sticking a stake in their hearts - and he was getting money for that.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Bulzesti is a hive of fiction. The 20th century Romanian poet Marin Sorescu was born here, and the villagers are proud of his legacy. There are stories that residents never go out at night, for fear of meeting the moroi. Sorescu writes in his poem \\u2018Dumneata\\u2019 (You), how the houses in Bulzesti are built far apart, so that at night the moroi have space to wander up and down the hill without disturbing the villagers. Golica says this is not a myth. It is true, but also, it is not true.    </p>    <p>     So he spins out a story where he was in a church on the other side of the hill, in the next village, with a priest from the neighbouring county of Valcea. The sun was going down. They were sitting on the church porch.    </p>    <p>     But they were afraid of what would happen when the night came.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWe gathered all the old wooden crosses together,\\u201d he claims, \\u201cand we made a bonfire with them - and then there were no moroi to eat us.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Sorescu\\u2019s poem follows a character, Grigore, who encounters a sick and putrid-smelling figure who addresses him with the polite form of \\u2018You\\u2019 (\\u2018Dumneata\\u2019 in Romanian, the equivalent of \\u2018Vous\\u2019 in French), who he believes to be a moroi. Another villager, Coza, tells him the moroi of Buzesti are high-strung and impulsive, and terrifies Grigore by stating: \\u201cWhen the moroi are angry with someone, they frighten them so much, that the victim\\u2019s body goes as limp as a rag used to clean a lamp.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     At the poem\\u2019s end, it becomes clear that Coza is mocking Grigore. He just wants to see how easy the man is to fool. Grigore\\u2019s gullibility means the local peasants end up giving him the nickname of \\u2018The Softy\\u2019.    </p>    <p>     So we drive out of the Village of the Imbeciles. Night begins to fall as we take a road over a hill back towards the highway. In front, we catch a shape moving, two shapes, hurtling across the road, and we stop the car suddenly. The vehicle brakes, we shudder and almost hit our heads on the dashboard. Two young deer nimble across the asphalt and leap into a small forest, and we sigh, almost breathless.    </p>    <p>     No signs or lamps are here to help us find our way back. Our route is only illuminated by headlights, which expose the sides of the roads, overgrown with weeds, and scattered with plastic and paper trash.    </p>    <p>     <br>      <span style=\\\"font-style:italic;\\\">       Additional reporting by Nicoleta Banila.      </span>     </br>    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Follow The Black Sea    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     <p align=\\\"center\\\">      <a href=\\\"https://facebook.com/TheBlackSeaEU/\\\">       <img src=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/public/img/icons/icon-fb.svg\\\"/>      </a>      <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/TheBlackSeaEU/\\\">       <img src=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/public/img/icons/icon-twitter.svg\\\"/>      </a>     </p>    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"e25138f1-0963-48d2-a9a6-b0639a8f13b2\"}]"}, "pk": 2017, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Nearly a century old, the Florentine brand was respected and distinguished, but lacked a vision to seduce millennials hungry for haute couture.    </p>    <p>     So Kering, Gucci\\u2019s French owner, promoted the Italian boss of its leather accessories specialist Bottega Veneta, Marco Bizzarri, to spearhead a new Gucci appealing to members of the Snapchat generation who had loads of cash.    </p>    <p>     Since taking up the job in early 2015, Bizzarri is credited with redefining an Italian classic, such as ending price-slashing on new collections, creating gender neutral items, adding a touch of geek chic, and banning the use of fur.    </p>    <p>     But his major stroke of genius was to appoint eccentric designer Alessandro Michele as creative director, and then give him the freedom to do what he wanted with the brand - no questions asked.    </p>    <p>     Gucci\\u2019s collections changed from conservative chic to edgy and unpredictable eclecticism.    </p>    <p>     And this risk paid off.    </p>    <p>     Sales for Kering\\u2019s top brand have boomed ever since Bizzarri\\u2019s appointment, and last year France awarded the 55-year-old Italian with the Legion of Honour.    </p>    <p>     But this talent comes at a cost.    </p>    <p>     At the end of 2014, the businessman negotiated with his bosses for a net salary of eight million Euro a year to lead Gucci.    </p>    <p>     During the first years of this new job, Bizzarri paid just 13 per cent income tax, compared to a 45 per cent rate for high earners in Italy.    </p>    <p>     That could mean a massive tax saving of around 3.2 million Euro per year.    </p>    <p>     The Italian brand managed this feat of accounting wizardry by paying Bizzarri through a company in Luxembourg and a residence in Switzerland.    </p>    <p>     The scheme was in the interests of Kering. The company paid just 0.36 per cent in social security contributions on Bizzarri\\u2019s 9.5 million gross salary at Gucci \\u2013 a small amount of 34,000 Euro. From this only 0.2 per cent was paid in Italy, a tiny figure of 19,000 Euro.    </p>    <p>     This means that while Italy\\u2019s premier brand cashes in on selling its snakeskin mini-bags and leather portfolios, the public purse in Milan is left wanting.    </p>    <p>     To establish such a structure, Bizzarri\\u2019s tax set-up was personally validated by Kering\\u2019s majority shareholder Fran\\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the seventh richest man in France, and owner of a family fortune worth 19 billion Euro.    </p>    <p>     These revelations emerge from confidential internal documents obtained by French online news site Mediapart, and analysed by partners in the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) network.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Tax evasion suspicion on \\u201cmonstrous scale\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The Italian cops have wised up to Gucci.

The suspicion: tax evasion on a monstrous scale.    </p>    <p>     Gucci is suspected of shifting a total of 1.3 billion Euro past the Italian treasury. This includes a scheme where its Italian-made products are sold from Switzerland, allowing the brand to concentrate its profits in the tax-friendly mountainous state, thus avoiding paying Italian tax, allege investigators.    </p>    <p>     As news of the raid leaked, Gucci confirmed the ongoing proceedings with a standard reaction. The company trusted that it had done nothing wrong, and was fully cooperating with investigators.    </p>    <p>     This lax attitude to tax seems to spread from the warehouse to the boardroom.

Outside an apartment block with a picturesque vista is a bell and a sign with Marco Bizzarri\\u2019s name.    </p>    <p>     This does not seem to be a busy abode. More than 30 letters are stacked in Bizzarri\\u2019s mailbox, and the blinds in front of the windows are down, giving the residence the feel of an offseason holiday flat.    </p>    <p>     To enjoy Switzerland\\u2019s favourable tax regime, no minimum presence in the country is required, and Bizzarri can take in the lake and mountain views during sunny weekends, or on holidays.    </p>    <p>     Meanwhile the Swiss taxman considers that foreign revenues have already been taxed abroad. Therefore the taxable income is called a \\u2018forfeit\\u2019 which reflects what the resident spends in the country. For Bizzarri, this spending amounted to just 500,000 Swiss Francs, on which he paid 146,000 Euro in income tax.    </p>    <p>     Such a set-up may not satisfy the Italian authorities. They calculate that if an individual lives in Italy for more than 183 days a year, that person must pay their taxes in Italy.    </p>    <p>     This is hard for a hands-on manager like Bizzarri, who leads a multi-billion brand in Milan, 81 km south of Vico Morcote. The commute is around 90 minutes. There are traffic jams all along the route.    </p>    <p>     Bizzarri also has a more convenient home in Milan. In 2009, his employers procured him an apartment in the centre of Italy\\u2019s financial capital - but very discreetly. On 23 July 2009, an Italian company called BV Servizi, represented by its chairman Marco Bizzarri, signed a four-year contract for a luxury penthouse apartment in Piazza Diaz, central Milan, not far from the Duomo.    </p>    <p>     The annual cost was 88,500 Euro for the rent, plus 30,000 Euro in expenses, such as cleaning and security. It is hard to live in a better location in Milan. The \\u2018BV\\u2019 in BV Servizi stood for Bottega Veneta, Kering\\u2019s luxury bag brand, where Bizzarri was working at the time.    </p>    <p>     The contract stated that the apartment could not be used as an office, and only as a living space. The real purpose was to provide an apartment for Bizzarri in Milan, indicate later emails. In one of the messages, the suite is referred to as \\u2018Bizzarro House Milan\\u2019. Later in 2015, in a discussion concerning whether Gucci should take over the lease from Bottega Veneta, Bizzarri joked in an email: \\u201cJust do not let me end up under a bridge.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     On the mailbox in Milan today the name listed is Stefano Bizzarri, the son of Marco, who studies in Milan and, it appears, shacks up with Dad.    </p>    <p>     But Marco doesn\\u2019t pay the bills. Everything is in the name of the company - BV Servizi. There is nothing to break the illusion that Bizarri lives in Switzerland.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     The Luxembourg Link    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     When Kering hired Bizzarri to rescue Gucci at the end of 2014, he knew he was a high value asset - and the top management was ready to offer him big bucks.    </p>    <p>     Francois-Henri Pinault, the French majority shareholder and CEO of the Kering group, met with Bizzarri and proposed an exorbitant salary. This was not only at the expense of the corporate group. The Italian treasury would also pay heavily.    </p>    <p>     This is revealed in a mail to Bizzarri, which came shortly after the meeting. Kering\\u2019s managing director Jean-Fran\\u00e7ois Palus, the right-hand man of Pinault, confirmed the offer: \\u201cYou will see in the attached documents that, given your status as a non-resident in Italy, the salary components give an estimated total remuneration of 8,041 K Euros as net salary.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     That means 8.041 million Euro in the Gucci boss\\u2019s pocket.    </p>    <p>     The residence in Switzerland was not the only trick. Bizzarri had two employment contracts - one with the Italian subsidiary Guccio Gucci, and a second with a letterbox company in Luxembourg, Castera. This \\u2018shell\\u2019 firm in Luxembourg was already set up to employ Bizzarri at his previous Kering job at Bottega Veneta.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWe suggest two employment contracts,\\u201d said Pinault's close aide Jean-Fran\\u00e7ois Palus. The first was an employee contract with Castera in Luxembourg - worth 5.8 million Euro per year, and the second a director's contract with the Italian company Guccio Gucci at 3.6 million Euro.    </p>    <p>     Here appears to be a sleight of hand:    </p>    <p>     \\u201cMr. Bizzarri does not carry out any activities as an employee in Luxembourg,\\u201d wrote the Castera tax consultant in a 2013 email. The salary is therefore not taxed in the Grand Duchy. \\u201cIn all papers we have stated that Mr. Bizzarri is a Swiss resident.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Therefore income for the Italian CEO of the Italian brand flowed through Luxembourg, and landed in Switzerland, where it fell under the tiny tax rate for super-rich foreigners.    </p>    <p>     According to Kering\\u2019s internal calculations, Bizzarri paid 146,000 Euro in taxes in Switzerland on his 5.8 million Euro salary through Luxembourg.    </p>    <p>     However Bizzarri would have to pay at least some tax in Italy. The remaining 3.65 million Euro is paid by the Italian company Guccio Gucci, using a deduction at source of 1.2 million Euro. This equals 33 per cent of the Swiss resident\\u2019s income, in contrast to the rate of 50 per cent he would be expected to pay on all taxes as a high-earner resident in Italy, according to Mediapart\\u2019s calculations.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     And how do Gucci and Bizzarri respond?    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     According to one source, the boss of Gucci decided in 2017 to become an Italian tax resident.

In 2011 he obtained an arrest warrant against the current Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, and other government and opposition officials, following accusations that Kenyatta orchestrated police violence against civilians that resulted in over a thousand deaths. But a lack of evidence and witnesses, as well as political developments in Kenya, forced Bensouda to drop the trial in     <a href=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/article/en/icc-ocampo-kenya\\\">      2015     </a>     .    </p>    <p>     The e-mails show that Bensouda contacted Ocampo several times about the Kenya case.    </p>    <p>     The first time was six months into her new appointment, in February 2013, when Ocampo had a request for his protege:    </p>    <p>     \\u201cCan we talk? I'm worried about the Kenya case,\\u201d he said.    </p>    <p>     Bensouda responded positively. \\u201cThank you, Luis. I have tried several times to reach you. I'd like to talk to you before I make a decision.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Shortly after, Bensouda announced that she was ending proceedings against one of Kenyatta's associates. They continued to discuss the proceedings until they fell apart completely in 2015.    </p>    <p>     This is not the only instance. While Ocampo only offered advice on Kenya, at another time he was more directly involved.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Colombia: Sensitive Info Shared    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Shortly after his retirement, Ocampo began mediating between the Colombian government and the Farc rebels, which had been in a bloody war for over 40 years. At the same time, the International Criminal Court investigated both sides for evidence of war crimes.    </p>    <p>     On 23 July 2013, Ocampo wrote to Bensouda: \\u201cI need to understand your view of Colombia. I'll go there in September.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Bensouda replied, \\u201cOk. I'll send you a summary.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Remarkably, a few weeks later, Bensouda informed Ocampo, via her private email, that she had sent a letter to the President of the Colombian Constitutional Court, making her position on the peace negotiations in Colombia clear. She enclosed the letter in the mail to Ocampo.    </p>    <p>     Another time, Ocampo tried to get his clients an audience with Bensouda. In 2015, he was privately helping the Iraqi persecuted minority, the Yezidis, and organisations in support of their cause, to start a case at the ICC against members of ISIS, who had been abducting and raping Yezidi women and murdering Yezidi men.    </p>    <p>     He could not call the court directly, he said, because of his role as its former prosecutor.    </p>    <p>     So how was he able to help? On 3 September, 2015, he made contact with Bensouda on his clients' behalf. \\u201cHello Fatou,\\u201d he e-mailed. \\u201cCan we talk? I would like to explain to you the Yazidi case and ask you what to do about it.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     \\u201cDear Luis,\\u201d she replied \\u201cI hope you are well. Of course we can talk. Perhaps Saturday evening will be good for you. You can call me from 8.00pm my time. Have a nice weekend and looking forward to speaking with you.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     A few weeks later, on 24 September 2015, Bensouda met with Yezidi emissaries at The Hague to discuss a possible criminal investigation. Bensouda had asked to keep the meeting secret, but Ocampo advised his associates to announce a press conference, which was \\u201cthe most important thing\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     The event gained press coverage, which angered Bensouda, who did not want to raise expectations that a case could be brought against ISIS, especially as their activity was based in Iraq and Syria, two countries who were not signed up to the     <a href=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/article/en/icc-yezidi-lobby-scandal\\\">      ICC.     </a>    </p>    <p>     After the Yezidi affair, she began to distance herself from Ocampo. When he and his staff contacted her office a month later to discuss a draft report by opposition groups in Venezuela, accusing its President, Nicolas Maduro, of crimes against humanity, torture and murder, she rejected a meeting, saying she had a \\u201cfull schedule\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     The Ocampo group assumed Bensouda was afraid of the publicity. A few days later, the Venezuelan opposition delivered their report to the ICC - but there was no talk of a meeting with Bensouda in the media.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Oversight mechanism: Operational 15 years after Court began    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Like her two employees, Bensouda might also end up facing questions by the Independent Oversight Mechanism (IOM) over these secret contacts with Ocampo and sharing of confidential documents, which she explicitly denied.    </p>    <p>     But however the investigation develops, there is a question mark over the IOM and the power it has to scrutinize ICC staff.    </p>    <p>     A few days after #CourtSecrets was published, on 11 October 2017, Ocampo posted a letter on his own website addressed to his successor, Fatou Bensouda.    </p>    <p>     He asked Bensouda to transmit to the Presidency of the court \\u201cmy offer to fully cooperate with the IOM authorities and regarding the scope of the inquiry.\\u201d He also suggested that some staff at the Court organized leaks against him.    </p>    <p>     It is ironic that he would invite scrutiny by the oversight body, because, according to the e-mails, during his final years at the ICC, Ocampo battled to limit the IOM\\u2019s power, which would have forced him make financial disclosures, including his two offshore companies.    </p>    <p>     So substantial was his opposition that in November 2011, the President of the Assembly of the States Parties, a parliament of the 124 member states that finance the ICC, wrote to Ocampo, warning him, \\u201cDon\\u2019t conspire about the IOM too much!!!\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Although it was established in 2009 by the Assembly of States Parties, the IOM has only been operational since the beginning of this year.    </p>    <p>     It is responsible for investigating only the administrative aspects of the Court, rather than its judicial functions, but its existence alone was enough to prompt Ocampo to accuse the member states of the Court of trying to undermine his independence. This argument was widely echoed by NGOs.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo also set about campaigning to limit measures protecting ICC whistleblowers and ensuring that the IOM could only investigate his office with the approval of the Prosecutor. In other words, only he could authorize an investigation into himself or his staff.    </p>    <p>     Ironically, after leaving the Court in 2012, Ocampo joined the New York law office Getnik &amp; Getnik, specializing in the lucrative whistleblowing business, where his firm would be in a position to obtain financial rewards from the U.S. tax authority the IRS, by supplying them with company financial data detailing possible tax fraud.    </p>    <p>     In 2011, delegates from several states waited for Ocampo to leave before continuing the discussions about starting the IOM and oversight rules.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cIt [would] be good to postpone the decision as the Prosecutor dealt [with it] as if it [were a] personal affair,\\u201d wrote one diplomat.    </p>    <p>     Several states suspect Ocampo of blocking the measures, and lodged complaints about this issue. It would take until 2013 for the IOM rules to be adopted, and another four years for it to become fully operational.    </p>    <p>     By this time Ocampo had left his office. Therefore he was never required to disclose the existence of secret companies in Panama and the British Virgin Islands, which he held while in his public position. Also, he never felt scrutiny over how he routinely transferred confidential Court files from official e-mail to his private account.    </p>    <p>     One week after our revelations, the Court assured that it \\u201cwas not aware of any of [Ocampo's] private financial arrangements while he served as Prosecutor\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Asked by Mediapart, Human Rights Watch's director, Ken Roth felt that \\u201cif Ocampo actually held offshore bank accounts, then it becomes difficult to trust his independence. No matter what he did with his accounts.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Two weeks ago, when magazine Der Spiegel quizzed Ocampo himself on whether he told the Court about his offshore arrangements, he answered briefly that: \\u201cThey never asked.\\u201d    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Who is involved in the #courtsecrets project?    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     <strong>      Initiator:     </strong>     Fabrice Arfi (Mediapart)    </p>    <p>     <strong>      Reporters:     </strong>     Fabrice Arfi, St\\u00e9phanie Maupas, Fanny Pigeaud (Mediapart), Sven Becker, Marian Blasberg, Dietmar Pieper (Der Spiegel), Hanneke Chin-A-Fo (NRC Handelsblad), Amanda Strydom, (ANCIR); Michael Bird, Zeynep Sentek, Craig Shaw (RCIJ/TBS); Bla\\u017e Zgaga (Nacional); Alain Lallemand, Jo\\u00ebl Matriche (Le Soir); Paula Guisado (El Mundo); Stefano Vergine (L'Espresso); Micael Pereira (Expresso); Jonathan Calvert, George Arbuthnott (The Sunday Times)    </p>    <p>     <strong>      Tech and info-design:     </strong>     Alex Morega, Gabriel Vijiala (RCIJ/TBS); Stephan Heffner (Der Spiegel); Nicolas Barthe-Dejean, Donatien Huet (Mediapart); Marien Jonkers (NRC Handelsblad)    </p>    <p>     <strong>      Project Guide:     </strong>     \\u0218tefan C\\u00e2ndea    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Follow The Black Sea    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     <p align=\\\"center\\\">      <a href=\\\"https://facebook.com/TheBlackSeaEU/\\\">       <img src=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/public/img/icons/icon-fb.svg\\\"/>      </a>      <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/TheBlackSeaEU/\\\">       <img src=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/public/img/icons/icon-twitter.svg\\\"/>      </a>     </p>    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"0f2e43e4-0f14-46e4-ab8b-e90ce72d03e4\"}]"}, "pk": 2019, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

The Hague, Netherlands. The office of the International Criminal Court (ICC) - the world body which aims to bring war criminals and perpetrators of genocide to justice.    </p>    <p>     Its Chief Prosecutor, the Argentinian Luis Moreno Ocampo, is preparing to end his nine-year mandate.    </p>    <p>     Three years previously, the Palestinian Authority demanded an investigation into crimes of Israeli occupation of its territory. Now Ocampo is winding up the case without success.    </p>    <p>     But he is afraid of the PR fallout from what looks to many as a failure of nerve to take on Israel. For this delicate procedure, it is neither his deputy, Fatou Bensouda, nor his press office, that he asks for advice on how to announce the closure.    </p>    <p>     It is Angelina Jolie.    </p>    <p>     On 2 April 2012, Ocampo sends an email to the star of Disney\\u2019s \\u2018Maleficent\\u2019 and Oscar-winner for \\u2018Girl, Interrupted\\u2019. The subject line is \\u2018how to present a decision on Palestine?\\u2019 and attached are secret court documents.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cOn Tuesday, I will decide that the Office cannot investigate alleged crimes in Palestine,\\u201d writes Ocampo. \\u201cPalestinian officials understand and respect my decision.

It is confidential\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     It is not clear why Ocampo has chosen multimillionaire Hollywood celebrity and film director Angelina Jolie as the individual to understand how to communicate complex international judicial procedures to \\u2018normal people\\u2019, other than her experience as an activist in the Balkans.    </p>    <p>     Nor does Jolie keep the information confidential. She speaks with her own advisor on the Palestine issue.    </p>    <p>     Her advice to Ocampo is that she sees this as an opportunity to explain to people \\u201cthe way the court works\\u201d and because \\u201crules must be followed\\u201d this decision could help \\u201cfurther legitimise the court\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Jolie is not the only outsider who advises this prosecutor. According to documents obtained by Mediapart and analyzed by the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC), Ocampo has his own \\u2018inner court\\u2019 of advisors including Hollywood glitterati, billionaire tech entrepreneurs, and philanthropists, mostly from the U.S. and the Arabian peninsula.    </p>    <p>     These include Sheikha Mozah, wife of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, Emir of Qatar until 2013; the founder of eBay, Pierre Omidyar and his wife Pamela; and A-List actor, George Clooney.    </p>    <p>     All are celebrities wanting to bring justice to Africa - but they do not know how, and cannot really help.    </p>    <p>     Despite this lack of expertise, Ocampo is willing to indulge their desires to make the world a better place.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     \\u201cAngelina Jolie has the idea to invite Kony for dinner and then arrest him\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     In 2005, the ICC issued five arrest warrants against the leaders of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), including its leader Joseph Kony. The brutal militia, then active in Uganda, kidnapped children and forced them into soldiery for two decades. As it plundered villages, the army left a horrific signature - cutting off the lips of its victims.    </p>    <p>     After the failure of a peace negotiation, the militia broke into small units in neighboring countries, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Central African Republic and Sudan.    </p>    <p>     In 2010, at the instigation of two American NGOs seeking to bring Kony to justice, Invisible Children and Enough Project, Washington sends more than 100 combat-equipped soldiers to \\u2018advise\\u2019 the locals on how to track down Kony.    </p>    <p>     After failing to catch Kony, the Californian NGO launches, in April 2012, the operation \\u2018Stop Kony\\u2019 with a 30 minute explainer video, asking the Internet to \\u2018make Kony famous\\u2019.    </p>    <p>     Within hours, the 30-minute film goes viral. Invisible Children sells its merchandise - Kony posters and T-shirts - to schoolchildren, thus inviting kids to put up the face of the world\\u2019s public enemy number one on their bedroom walls.    </p>    <p>     Soon the backlash begins. The video oversimplifies the Ugandan conflict, by failing to see the atrocities committed by all sides in central Africa, and possibly over-exaggerating the quantity of crimes of Kony himself, even if the real situation is still heinous.

On 26 October, citizens of the east African state will go to the polls for the second time in three months to choose between the country's two rivals, incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.    </p>    <p>     Kenyatta\\u2019s victory in last August\\u2019s vote was overturned by Kenya\\u2019s Supreme Court, following a complaint from Odinga, which alleged the vote had been electronically manipulated to favor his competitor.    </p>    <p>     The country is holding its breath, because political disagreements over electoral rigging previously lead to mass-murder in Kenya.    </p>    <p>     In December 2007, Raila Odinga lost the presidential election to then-incumbent Mwai Kibaki, who had ruled since 2002.    </p>    <p>     Protests in support of Odinga broke out, and the government deployed police and paramilitary units to put down the demonstrations, resulting in over 1,100 dead and more than 350,000 displaced.    </p>    <p>     The extreme violence perpetrated by the Kenyan state led The Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an investigation into who was personally responsible for the tragedy.    </p>    <p>     In 2010, the ICC prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, announced he was targeting six officials, three from each of the two sides. One of them was Kenyatta - accused of planning and funding violence in support of President Mwai Kibaki.    </p>    <p>     The announcement propelled Ocampo to become a high-profile personality in Kenya, who even had his own puppet on satirical Kenyan TV program,     <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW0-YOZQOho\\\">      XYZ     </a>     .    </p>    <p>     But Kenyatta hit back hard at the allegations - using them as an excuse to cement his grip on power. In early 2013, he formed an alliance with William Ruto, an opponent and ally of Odinga, who is also charged by the ICC for crimes against humanity.    </p>    <p>     The goal was to unite the supporters of the two main ethnic groups of the country: the Kikuyus and the Kalenjins.    </p>    <p>     What also bound them together was a shared antipathy towards western judicial interference.    </p>    <p>     Kenyatta\\u2019s rival Odinga took the opportunity to mock the future president, stating that if he wins, he will have to rule the country via Skype from The Hague, while he awaits trial.    </p>    <p>     But Kenyatta had the last laugh.

Christmas 2012. The ICC prosecution is due to present its brief on the joint trial of Kenyatta and another ICC defendant, Francis Muthaura, a former Cabinet secretary to President Mwai Kibaki, scheduled for 15 April 2013.    </p>    <p>     However \\u201cP0014\\u201d, the main direct witness in the case against Muthaura, is considered unreliable by the leading prosecutors in the case.    </p>    <p>     But the new ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, hesitates to withdraw the charges.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo decides to intervene. He left the court in June 2012 after nine years at office, but retains allies in The Hague. One of the lawyers at the office of the Prosecutor informs him of the complications of the case.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo, who now works in a private New York law practice, contacts Sara Criscitelli, hired by the court after working as an official in the US Department of Justice.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo advises her to keep the file open, to denounce Kenya's lack of cooperation and request a postponement of the case.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cBlame them [Kenya] before they blame the prosecutor,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWe need to defend the office of the prosecutor. If they filled [filed, sic] before us that the case should be dismissed for lack of evidence we will be badly exposed.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     At that time, an ill wind is blowing through the ICC. A few weeks earlier, a Congolese militiaman had already been acquitted by the Court for lack of evidence.    </p>    <p>     The American is nevertheless worried. \\u201cIf we file something that suggests that a State can defeat the court simply by refusing to cooperate, that will be the death of the Court as a whole,\\u201d she writes.    </p>    <p>     But it seems Ocampo wants to save his name. He was the one who put his personal reputation on the line in the Kenya case and opened an investigation which has failed to secure any convictions.    </p>    <p>     At the end of February 2013, Fatou Bensouda contacts Luis Moreno Ocampo to discuss the Kenyan issue \\u201cbefore taking a decision\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Asked by French media group Mediapart, her spokesperson says: \\u201cProsecutor Bensouda did not seek the former Prosecutor\\u2019s [Ocampo] advice on any of these matters.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     According to our information however, on at least two occasions she referred to the case in conversations with her predecessor.    </p>    <p>     On 4 March 2013, Kenyatta, still an accused war criminal, wins the Kenyan Presidential election, with his co-defendant, Ruto, as his deputy. A week later Bensouda withdraws the charges brought against co-accused Francis Muthaura.    </p>    <p>     The new Kenyan president starts attacking the ICC on several fronts. On the judicial side, he hires prestigious lawyers and the services of Quintel Intelligence, a private intelligence agency, to carry out a counter-investigation.    </p>    <p>     On the political side, he lobbies the African Union. The climax of this diplomatic campaign takes place in November 2013 before the United Nations Security Council. Together with others, Kenya asks the intergovernmental body in New York to order the ICC to suspend the two cases of crimes against humanity during the 2007 election.    </p>    <p>     In an electric confrontation, African representatives accuse world leaders of neo-colonialism. The western powers face a tough choice. Should they interfere with the processes of the Court and stop the indictments, or risk alienating Kenya, which is a key ally in the fight against the terrorism of militia group Al Shabaab in Somalia?    </p>    <p>     In The Hague, the ICC\\u2019s Assembly of States Parties, a kind of Court parliament, meets a week later. Behind the scenes, an American diplomat mentions a \\u201cwin-win situation\\u201d: a strategy to withdraw the charges against Kenyatta for lack of evidence, on the basis that Nairobi does not cooperate. The new Kenyan Head of State would thus be rid of the Court, which would also not face humiliation.    </p>    <p>     For two months, Ocampo had been working on this strategy.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Ex-Prosecutor Ocampo on Kenya: \\u201cYou can\\u2019t prosecute a head of state with a weak case\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     In September 2013, Ocampo explains to an interlocutor at New York law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling that he is talking with Fatou Bensouda \\u201cto organize an external group of prominent lawyers to review the evidence in the Kenyatta case.

Witnesses are found dead, possibly     <a href=\\\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30703876\\\">      murdered     </a>     , and others are deemed corrupt or face intimidation.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo goes as far as contacting Kofi Annan. The former United Nations General Secretary has been appointed by the African Union to head up a dialogue and reconciliation process for Kenya.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cI think it is time to find an honorable exit for Kenyata (sic),\\u201d Ocampo tells the peace negotiator, in an incredible reversal of his previous position.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo advises Annan to send someone to the ICC for a few days to meet with the prosecutor and her deputy, the judges, and the president of the court. With what appears to be a certain cynicism, he says this should be \\u201can African, not a lawyer\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo says the envoy needs to ask the question to the ICC about whether there can be a legal solution for Kenyatta, while specifying that the Kenyan head of state \\u201cshould not be perceived escaping justice\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Kofi Annan is laconic: \\u201cWe are indeed living in interesting times,\\u201d he says, before advocating \\u201clet\\u2019s wait and see\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Scheduled for 12 November 2013, the Kenyatta trial is again postponed at the request of the prosecution for lack of solid evidence.    </p>    <p>     For Ocampo, it is a good opportunity to carry out his maneuvers. In December 2013, at a reception in New York, he discusses the exit strategy with Macharia Kamau, a Kenyan diplomat from the United Nations, who is close to Kenyatta.    </p>    <p>     Later on, the diplomat explains that he has contacted Kenyatta\\u2019s brother, who is ready to meet the former prosecutor in New York.    </p>    <p>     But only the new prosecutor Fatou Bensouda can decide, says the Argentinian, before setting out the broad lines of his strategy.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo states to the well-connected Kenyan diplomat: \\u201cPresident Kenyatta should not look for a political solution because such [a] solution will affect his reputation and legitimacy. It will sound [like] he was guilty and is just abusing... his own power to escape from justice.\\u201d [Macharia Kamau did not answer EIC's questions].    </p>    <p>     Ocampo also makes the suggestion that: \\u201cPresident Kenyatta should create a system to offer reparations to all the victims. In this way President Kenyatta could achieve a positive result and gain recognition inside and outside Kenya.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Bensouda has to face the reality of the situation. The file she has inherited from Ocampo is too weak. In December 2014, summoned by the judges, the prosecutor eventually throws in the towel.    </p>    <p>     She withdraws the charges against Kenyatta, who claims victory, and she promises to drop the case against his running mate, Ruto, whose trial began in September 2013.    </p>    <p>     In April 2016, the trial of William Ruto is closed without any result, bringing an end to the case against the Kenyan suspects accused of crimes against humanity.    </p>    <p>     Soon the \\u2018Ocampo-six\\u2019 as the local press calls the case, becomes the \\u2018Ocampo-zero\\u2019.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Who is involved in the #courtsecrets project?    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     <strong>      Initiator:     </strong>     Fabrice Arfi (Mediapart)    </p>    <p>     <strong>      Reporters:     </strong>     Fabrice Arfi, St\\u00e9phanie Maupas, Fanny Pigeaud (Mediapart), Sven Becker, Marian Blasberg, Dietmar Pieper (Der Spiegel), Hanneke Chin-A-Fo (NRC Handelsblad), Amanda Strydom, (ANCIR); Michael Bird, Zeynep Sentek, Craig Shaw (RCIJ/TBS); Bla\\u017e Zgaga (Nacional); Alain Lallemand, Jo\\u00ebl Matriche (Le Soir); Paula Guisado (El Mundo); Stefano Vergine (L'Espresso); Micael Pereira (Expresso); Jonathan Calvert, George Arbuthnott (The Sunday Times)    </p>    <p>     <strong>      Tech and info-design:     </strong>     Alex Morega, Gabriel Vijiala (RCIJ/TBS); Stephan Heffner (Der Spiegel); Nicolas Barthe-Dejean, Donatien Huet (Mediapart); Marien Jonkers (NRC Handelsblad)    </p>    <p>     <strong>      Project Guide:     </strong>     \\u0218tefan C\\u00e2ndea    </p>    <p>     <span class=\\\"disclaimer\\\">      Pictures (main picture): Uhuru Kenyatta, President of Kenya (wikimedia commons)     </span>    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Follow The Black Sea    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     <p align=\\\"center\\\">      <a href=\\\"https://facebook.com/TheBlackSeaEU/\\\">       <img src=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/public/img/icons/icon-fb.svg\\\"/>      </a>      <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/TheBlackSeaEU/\\\">       <img src=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/public/img/icons/icon-twitter.svg\\\"/>      </a>     </p>    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"478d0b38-a998-42a2-b262-551aa565b81c\"}]"}, "pk": 2021, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Rain and wind. A hit of Autumn. Five people leave the headquarters of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the judicial body financed by 124 nations to prosecutes war criminals and mass murderers. Among the group is Kerry Propper, a Wall Street banker and philanthropist dedicated to combating genocide.    </p>    <p>     Next to him is the foreign minister of the Kurdish region in Iraq and three representatives of interest groups Yazda and Free Yezidi. They support the cause of the Yezidis - a religious minority targeted by Islamic State (IS) in Iraq, where 10,000s were ethnically cleansed from their homes in the town of Sinjar.    </p>    <p>     On the front steps is a press conference, which only a handful of journalists attend. But from the entrance, the officials want to show the world that someone, somewhere cares about the fate of these victims. They want to make the point that, despite silence in the international community, it is possible to bring the war criminals of Islamic State before a court. After all, that is why the International Criminal Court exists - to crush the world\\u2019s bullies.    </p>    <p>     Inside the court, they have spoken with the ICC\\u2019s chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, to plead for an investigation into atrocities against the Yezidis.    </p>    <p>     They handed her a report packed with facts and testimonies. The IS massacre of Yezidis on Mount Sinjar in 2014. The young boys abducted and brainwashed to become new IS fighters. The ongoing violence against thousands of girls and women, who are held as sex slaves.    </p>    <p>     Bensouda has listened, and if the lobbyists have this global justice enforcer on their side, and she takes up the case, there is a chance for justice.    </p>    <p>     But what should have been an honest defence of a persecuted minority transforms into a fiasco that upsets the court\\u2019s rules and procedures with false declarations and conflicts of interest, as we reveal in #courtsecrets - documents obtained by French website Mediapart, analyzed by NRC and journalism network European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) [for more information on #courtsecrets     <a href=\\\"https://theblacksea.eu/stories/article/en/court-secrets-ocampo-explainer\\\">      read our explainer     </a>     ]    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Nothing the Court can do against Iraq and Syria    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Five months earlier, in April 2015, Bensouda issued a statement saying there is probably nothing she can do against Islamic State (IS), because the terror group primarily operates in Syria and Iraq, countries that do not recognize the ICC\\u2019s jurisdiction.    </p>    <p>     There is a legal detour. Many IS fighters are from countries who do sign up to the court, including many in Europe. These fighters could be brought to justice. The interest groups are convinced it can be done. In their report they collect additional evidence against IS fighters from outside Iraq and Syria.    </p>    <p>     But this is an indirect route to justice. The prosecutor\\u2019s job is to concentrate on the chief instigators of war crimes and genocide, who are most probably Syrians and Iraqis.    </p>    <p>     Yazda and Free Yezidi are helped by the best ally they could wish for: the Argentine lawyer Luis Moreno Ocampo. Between 2003 and 2012 he was first chief prosecutor of the ICC. During those years Bensouda was his deputy prosecutor.    </p>    <p>     Since leaving The Hague, Ocampo lectures at Harvard, and works as a lawyer and consultant. In August 2015, the American banker Kerry Propper, a board member of lobby group Yazda, asks him to help with the Yezidi mission.    </p>    <p>     Propper leads a double life, he says in interviews. He is the CEO of an investment bank and an activist raising awareness about genocide. First the Holocaust and Rwanda, and this time the Yezidis. He wants to lobby key states, the United Nations and the ICC. Ocampo's network must open these doors. Propper gladly pays the expenses.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo does the job pro bono. The website of his current consulting practice in New York, Ocampo Moreno LLC, devotes a lengthy article to his efforts for the Yezidis.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cMr. Moreno Ocampo decided not to personally engage the ICC because of his former role as the first Chief Prosecutor. Instead, he outlined the process and the requisites for Yazda to present the Yazidi situation before the ICC.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     This means that Ocampo helps the lobby groups, but does not contact his former employer - the court - directly, and he does not take part in The Hague delegation in September 2015.    </p>    <p>     But his statement on a lack of personal engagement is not true.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed \\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/stories/public/img/articles/icc-yezidi-lobby-scandal/2moreno.jpg\\\"/>    </div>    <div class=\\\"caption\\\">     <p>      Ex-Chief Prosecutor Ocampo: clash between his statements and actions     </p>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The documents in EIC\\u2019s possession show that Ocampo did contact chief prosecutor Bensouda to promote the Yezidis\\u2019 cause.

She agrees. The next day, he tells a former staff member of Bensouda that he spoke with the chief prosecutor \\u201cto provide her clarity on what [the Yezidis] try to do and achieve\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     This former ICC employee is Olivia Swaak-Goldman, who worked as an international cooperation advisor in the Prosecutor\\u2019s office during both Ocampo\\u2019s and Bensouda\\u2019s tenure. She has been away from the court for two years, but still has good contacts there. Ocampo asks her to assist in the lobby. Kerry Propper agrees to pay her 3,000 USD for the assignment.    </p>    <p>     Swaak will arrange and prepare the meeting between the interest groups and the prosecutor. Ocampo tells Swaak he is working on the report that the delegation will hand to Bensouda.    </p>    <p>     Documents show it is mainly Ocampo's legal assistant, also a former staff member of the prosecutor's office, who writes the report. Ocampo advises her on legal issues to be included, and the interest groups provide witness statements. Yazda and Free Yezidi however are the only authors mentioned in the final version.    </p>    <p>     The meeting is to take place between September 20 and 25 2015. When Olivia Swaak does not receive confirmation on the date, Ocampo approaches his successor at the court, Bensouda, for a second time. The delegation needs to plan its trip to The Hague, he writes in an email. Bensouda replies that she has just instructed her staff.    </p>    <p>     The court does not have specific rules about how a former prosecutor should relate to his successor. But it is clear that the chief prosecutor must remain independent at all times. Bensouda receives requests for help from groups all over the world. She can only pursue the most important and promising cases, and must be able to justify her selection.    </p>    <p>     So if Bensouda were to investigate the plight of the Yezidis despite her earlier rejection, it must be clear that this is her independent decision. Not an attempt to do her former boss a favour.    </p>    <p>     Ocampo turns to one of Bensouda's current employees for his mission. Florence Olara is a spokesperson for the prosecutor and also worked for Ocampo when he was in office.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     \\u201cStaff may not accept instructions from outsiders\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     For Olara, there are clear office rules. A code of conduct has been in place for the Office of the Prosecutor since 2013. It says, among other things, that staff may not accept instructions from outsiders and not do anything that could affect the confidence in the independence of the office.    </p>    <p>     Yet these rules are tested when Ocampo asks Olara to organize the Yezidi press conference. From an email by Ocampo\\u2019s legal assistant, it is clear that Olara is aware of the conflict of interest.    </p>    <p>     The assistant writes to Ocampo that Olara is not feeling comfortable.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cEspecially the fact that Flo [Florence Olara] works for the court and is not supposed to be organising the press conference.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     The delegation cannot use Olara\\u2019s name in front of the prosecutor, she warns. This is even more apparent, because Bensouda wants the meeting to remain confidential. This need for secrecy does not seem to fit well with a press conference on the Court\\u2019s front steps.    </p>    <p>     The assistant to Ocampo writes: \\u201cWould it be possible to run all the correspondences through you or me, or as Flo suggested, to use a fake email I created for her using a pseudonym?\\u201d She says Olara \\u201ccannot put her job on the line for this\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     So Olara uses a false name, Oliver Tuscany, when she asks Ocampo for 8,000 dollars to organise the press conference. She promises to arrange the presence of major international media. Ocampo tells his sponsor, Kerry Propper, that Oliver Tuscany is a \\u201cpartner\\u201d of Olara, and that Olara cannot join openly because she still works at the ICC. Like Ocampo, Propper seems to have no objection. But he thinks the requested sum is too high. Olara has to settle for 5,000 dollars.    </p>    <p>     Through her lawyer, Olara states that she did not organise the press conference, she did not get paid to do so, and that she spent that day at her work. Olara adds that she never used a false identity.    </p>    <p>     But some of these points do not cohere with Kerry Propper\\u2019s statement. When we asked the philanthropist why he let Florence Olara organise the press conference and media outreach, while she was also working for the Office of the Prosecutor, he replied: \\u201cI was told she has good press contacts.\\u201d    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Fear of \\u201cincreased expectations\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Bensouda is upset when she finds out the press are on the doorstep, and when Reuters publishes a report mentioning that the Yezidis personally met the prosecutor. She is afraid this will increase expectations among the persecuted groups, or disappointment if she does not start an investigation.    </p>    <p>     Again, Ocampo sees no problem. He considers the press conference the most important part of the trip to Holland, he writes to Propper. Bensouda has no right to keep genocide victims from expressing their sorrow, he says to the team. He urges Yazda and Free Yezidi to spread the Reuters report among the Yezidis in refugee camps in Iraq.    </p>    <p>     Bensouda did not start an investigation into the crimes against the Yezidis after she received the report.    </p>    <p>     Two months later, Ocampo wants to send another delegation to The Hague. This time, he is helping victims from Venezuela. Bensouda declines. She lets it be known that the Venezuelans can deliver their report, but that she has no time to receive them personally.    </p>    <p>     The court already has enough false expectations and disappointments.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     What do the current and former prosecutors say about this today?    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     While Ocampo has lobbied Prosecutor Bensouda on many occasions, the current Prosecutor said in statement that her bureau \\u201crefrains from initiating contact or engaging with Mr Ocampo\\u201d since he left office.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cThe Office in fact has a clear position on this matter and we, as a matter of policy, do not seek advice, consult or engage Mr Ocampo in any of the situations or matters before the Office or the Court.

In a near-bloodless annexation, the region fell under Vladimir Putin\\u2019s control.    </p>    <p>     But the Kremlin was left with a problem: Crimea was poor, isolated from Russia by water, and its already weak economy was facing decimation following the break from Kyiv. To keep the territory would cost Russia billions of dollars in subsidies.    </p>    <p>     What was the solution?    </p>    <p>     Foreign investment.    </p>    <p>     Russia opened an     <a href=\\\"http://www.invest-in-crimea.ru\\\">      investment portal in English     </a>     promoting a Free Economic Zone in Crimea. The peninsula was to become Russia\\u2019s own tax haven.    </p>    <p>     Russia\\u2019s propaganda machine boasted of plans by Italians to invest 300 million Euro in Crimea\\u2019s     <a href=\\\"https://sputniknews.com/business/201607191043279318-crimea-italy-wine-investment/\\\">      wine industry     </a>     , and 250 million Euro from Germans in recycling,     <a href=\\\"https://www.rt.com/business/360364-crimea-germany-businesses-investments/\\\">      hotels and tourism     </a>     . This is despite both Germany and Italy recognising Crimea as territory belonging to Ukraine - and not Russia.    </p>    <p>     In 2014, Fiore's Associazione Alexandrite organized business trips for Italians to Russia - and the delegation headed straight to Crimea.    </p>    <p>     Interestingly, Fiore\\u2019s name was no longer visible on official documents relating to the association at that time.    </p>    <p>     But businessmen who participated in those meetings state that everything was run from Italy by the Forza Nuova boss, who went on to orchestrate a second delegation to Crimea in 2015.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cA friend introduced me to the association, of which I knew Mr. Fiore was the president,\\u201d says Diego Ebau, a small business entrepreneur from Sardinia, who participated in the trips. \\u201cMy goal and that of other dozens of companies who were there was not political. We just wanted to know more about the benefits of investing in Crimea.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     According to Ebau, if he invested at least 50,000 Euro in the peninsula, he would pay zero taxes for the first five years and enjoy a six per cent cap on taxes thereafter.    </p>    <p>     What could be more inviting for investors suffering from Italy\\u2019s labyrinthine tax regime, and the country\\u2019s incessant recessions?    </p>    <p>     But encouraging Italian firms to set up shop in Crimea is an odd move for this neofascist party, because at the core of its ideology is the defence of economic sovereignty, and a hatred of globalisation due to its threat to Italian     <a href=\\\"http://www.antonellaricciardi.it/interviste.asp?id=20\\\">      micro-businesses     </a>     .    </p>    <p>     Now some companies from Fiore\\u2019s Crimea trips have plans to shut down their factories in Italy and reopen them in Crimea.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cI left the Alexandrite Association after two trips, because I prefer to do things on my own,\\u201d says Ebau, \\u201cbut I know that a Puglia textile company is already in the process of moving production over there.

This periphery is a space of micro-universes, many crafted to perfection, but often isolated.    </p>    <p>     The neighbourhoods are rich in stories reminiscent of a fairytale - citizens cross frozen wastes searching for food, kill beasts in the wide open, herd sheep and goats, visit witches versed in spells and charms, and befriend strange creatures.    </p>    <p>     Many homes lack the necessary infrastructure to connect homes to the city. Houses are often built with no access to running water, electricity, asphalt roads or pavements. But residents have the same goal - to achieve a western standard of living.    </p>    <p>     Bucharest is a new city, and was only first mentioned as a settlement in the 15th Century. In 1862, it became the capital of a union of the Romanian-speaking principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, which remained vassal states of the Ottoman Empire until full independence in 1877.    </p>    <p>     The city grew in the second half of the 19th century and boomed between the two world wars, when rich and eccentric art deco and modernist buildings emerged throughout its centre.    </p>    <p>     But the Communists destroyed much of the city\\u2019s neighbourhoods, and added a new layer of identikit concrete apartment blocks, which now dominate the cityscape.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed larger\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" class='\\\"larger\\\"' src=\\\"/stories/public/img/articles/living-on-the-edge-photostory/02.jpg\\\"/>    </div>    <div class=\\\"caption\\\">     <p>      <p style=\\\"font-style:normal; font-size:medium; margin-bottom:3.5em;\\\">       \\u2018A flock of about 500 sheep and goats at a farm near apartment complex Confort City.

Today, these children are adults, and many work for European corporations, NGOs and IT firms.    </p>    <p>     According to Eurostat, Romanians have the highest rate in Europe for owner-occupied dwellings: 96.5 per cent in 2015. In the cities, the bulk of these residents are small, Communist-era apartments.    </p>    <p>     But the adult generation now want what they were promised: a Western life.

In July 2016, they were convicted by a Catalonian Court of failing to pay 4.1 million Euro in taxes on image rights between 2007 and 2009.    </p>    <p>     The pair received a large fine and a 21-month prison sentence in Barcelona. Because the Messis were first-time offenders, the judge did not send them to jail. Messi said he did not know about the deal, and his father claimed he was acting on legal advice.    </p>    <p>     During an audit of FC Barcelona in 2016, agents from Spain\\u2019s IRS, the Agencia Tributaria, stumbled across money transfers worth millions of Euro from the club to Messi's father and to the player's nonprofit charity, the Fundaci\\u00f3n Leo Messi, which aims to help children in need.    </p>    <p>     The inspectors demanded all documents on Barcelona\\u2019s multi-million Euro payments from 2010 to 2013 to the Fundaci\\u00f3n Leo Messi. Officials demanded Barca detail exactly what the club had paid for. There was a suspicion that the transfers of the club to the Foundation were not donations - but salary payments to Messi.    </p>    <p>     Barcelona seemed unsettled by the investigation. According to an internal email, the club's chief legal representative notified the Messis \\u201cout of loyalty\\u201d of the questions to which the authorities requested answers. Jorge Messi responded confidently: \\u201cDon't worry, we have become quite knowledgeable on these issues.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     But the club hired a renowned lawyer to examine the situation, who made it clear that Barcelona's position in this dispute was not ideal \\u2013 and Lionel Messi's status was even worse. The problem was that the Messis had disregarded legal requirements. For six years, they failed to finalise the registration of the foundation, which was opened in 2007, into Catalonia's registry of charities.    </p>    <p>     This means it was not a legal entity, even though it was receiving donations from Barcelona from 2010. From that period onwards, each renewal of the player with the club would come with a new payment commitment to its foundation.    </p>    <p>     However, because it was not a legal entity, the foundation should not have been able to take advantage of special tax benefits.    </p>    <p>     According to the Football Leaks documents, for years Barcelona was allowed to consider those payments as contributions to a foundation. In line with the tax advantages established for donations to such charities, these could have been applicable for a 35 per cent deduction in Corporate Tax.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Risk of player being subpoenaed \\u201cextremely high\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The tax lawyer who compiled the risk analysis contacted FC Barcelona lawyers in late July 2016.

This would be a disaster for Barcelona, as the team's tactics are tuned to exploit Messi's talents to the fullest.    </p>    <p>     After the club informed Messi, he regulated his tax situation regarding payments outside of his salary. This included millions of dollars in consultancy fees the club had paid to Messi's father and cash that FC Barcelona had transferred to the player's charitable foundation. In total, the football star needed to pay back taxes of around 12 million Euro.    </p>    <p>     But there are indications that the multimillion star agreed to this, because Barcelona - indirectly - would pick up the bill.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     The sum will \\u201cultimately be absorbed by FC Barcelona\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     A draft contract states that the club wanted to grant Lionel Messi a loan of 12 million Euro.

He and the club agreed on a bonus to his salary of 23.1 million Euro.    </p>    <p>     Not everyone at Barcelona was happy with this situation.    </p>    <p>     The club\\u2019s compliance officer, Sabine Paquer, voiced doubts about the loan period, the interest rate and additional clauses.    </p>    <p>     One club director asked the chief financial officer (CFO) to explain to Paquer that \\u201cthe club is not an ordinary company\\u201d and that \\u201cthis loan could help Leo extend his contract\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     The CFO also told the compliance officer by mail about the urgency of these contracts. \\u201cWe have to remember that this is the club's most significant asset,\\u201d he wrote.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Messi: \\u201c40 per cent\\u201d of staff costs for Barcelona team    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     To ensure that their superstar would remain tied to FC Barcelona beyond 2018, Barcelona club President Josep Maria Bartomeu, his deputy Jordi Mestre Masdeu and club CEO Oscar Grau drafted three core contracts, all of them written in Catalan. The first was an employment contract, countersigned on behalf of Lionel Messi by his father; the second was with the company Leo Messi Management S.L., pertaining to the player's image rights, likewise signed by Messi's father; and the third a contract with Messi's foundation in Barcelona.    </p>    <p>     If Messi fulfils the terms of the contract as a regular Barca player, the Argentine will receive from his club a guaranteed 106 million Euro per season - twice as much as the previous amount. This will rise to 122 million Euro if FC Barcelona wins the triple - the Champions League, the Spanish Championship and the Spanish Cup - and if Messi is named the best player in the world that season.    </p>    <p>     This means spending on Messi accounts for almost 40 per cent of the staff costs for the entire team.    </p>    <p>     The issue here - disputed by Barcelona - is whether the club is helping players transform their tax debts into guaranteed salary earnings.    </p>    <p>     When FC Barcelona extended its contracts with Messi at the end of June 2017, the two sides agreed to annul the bonus payment of 23.1 million Euro for the 2017/2018 season. Now that sum had become part of Messi's newly-agreed fixed salary.    </p>    <p>     The club has for years enjoyed millions of Euro in tax concessions from the Spanish state, but was now willing to compensate the tax authorities for the fiscal shenanigans of its star player, a man already convicted for tax evasion.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     How do Barcelona and Messi\\u2019s family respond to these allegations?    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Today Barcelona stands by its principles.

One of the lowest numbers in the EU. So why do they move abroad?    </p>    <p>     Firstly, there is no job security. Only 5.1 per cent of the working poor aged 16 to 64 have a permanent employment contact.    </p>    <p>     Secondly, wages are too low. The country has the second lowest minimum wage in the EU - at a net value of 1,065 Lei (232 Euro) per month. Over 230,000 citizens earn less than the minimum wage. The state has to top up the difference with benefits.    </p>    <p>     Thirdly, too many employers pay this rock-bottom salary. According to Labour Inspection agency data, around a third of contracts covering full and part time jobs pay the national minimum wage or under.    </p>    <p>     Romania\\u2019s average (median) salary, the net cash that families take home at the end of the day - is the EU\\u2019s lowest - at 2,448 Euro per annum, and has been since the crisis of 2008. Bulgaria beats it with 3,151 Euro, according to Eurostat.    </p>    <p>     This is set against the fact that prices of goods and energy costs are more or less the same as in western Europe.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     \\u201cAn increased number of sexual abuse cases\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     This behaviour of the children left behind changes. A 2012 UNICEF report, and a Soros Foundation study found that parent migration was one of the main causes of children leaving school early. In general, one in five kids in Romania leave school early. This rate is on the rise - to 19.1 per cent in 2015, according to an EU report.    </p>    <p>     Director of the Social Assistance and Child Protection Services (DGASPC) in Ia\\u015fi Niculina Karacsony says a major problem is that many children have not been prepared by their parents for a temporary separation.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWe\\u2019re not condemning parents who leave to earn a living abroad,\\u201d says Karacsony. \\u201cBut we are condemning those who do so without preparing their children for the separation, and who do not communicate often with them.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     This is backed up by Alex Gulei, executive director of Alternative Sociale, an NGO in Ia\\u015fi which works closely with DGASPC. \\u201cOne thing that comes up again and again is that they hate when parents forget to Skype at 7 pm as they are expecting, or promise to return on a date when they don\\u2019t,\\u201d says Gulei. \\u201cThey hate it when parents do not deliver on their word.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     In the most extreme cases, say experts, kids left behind by parents have died following irreversible depression. Another problem is domestic violence. Among the cases of children of migrant workers that are referred to DGASPC Ia\\u015fi, its director stresses \\u201can increased number in cases of sexual abuse\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     This most commonly happens within the family, and when mothers are not at home.

Meanwhile, the latest Government data shows that around 30 per cent of total contracts pay the national minimum wage or under. This is still a massive number, and contrasts with nine per cent in Germany.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cIn other countries, the minimum wage is the ceiling below which you shouldn\\u2019t pay.

As the global financial crash hit Europe, Romania was in a cash-flow crisis.    </p>    <p>     Desperate for money, it agreed to a 20-billion Euro bailout package in March 2009. The lenders were the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Commission, the World Bank (WB), and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).    </p>    <p>     The IMF put up the largest sum: 13 billion Euro.    </p>    <p>     But this was not charity. The cash came with conditions. The lenders wanted Romania to deregulate its labour market. The secretary general of the union Cartel Alfa, Petru Dandea, sat in the negotiations. In the meetings, he says that the EC and the IMF were keen to push for a flexible labour market, although the Commission did not specify how Romanian officials should loosen its labour laws.    </p>    <p>     But an     <a href=\\\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4175678-IMF-Memorandum-of-Understanding-122210.html\\\">      IMF technical memorandum from 2010     </a>     shows their experts were involved in helping draft the country\\u2019s Social Dialogue policy - the process of negotiation between workers, unions, employers and Government - and review the existing Labour Code, to replace Romania\\u2019s old regulations.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cBefore end-December (after consultation with social partners and with the IMF, the World Bank and the European Commission), we will send a revised social dialog code and an improved labor code to parliament,\\u201d reads a document written by then-Finance Minister Gheorghe Ialomi\\u0163ianu.    </p>    <p>     Avoiding any public debate, Romania's leaders launched draconian anti-labour policies. These were aimed at attacking workers' rights and reducing its unionised workforce, which dropped from approximately 90 per cent in 1991 to 20 per cent of workers today, according to Conect Association, an advocacy group.    </p>    <p>     In 2011, the Democratic Liberal-led Government of Prime Minister Emil Boc axed Romania\\u2019s yearly bargained National Contract from the old Labour Code. This contract contained a salary grid that forced businesses to factor in a person\\u2019s education level, professional skills and experience when calculating their pay.    </p>    <p>     With this protection removed, employers only had to comply with one law: paying the minimum wage.    </p>    <p>     Leaders of Cartel Alfa union, the National Union Block (BNS), the Retail Unions Federation and Conect Association agree this was a blow to salaries, and opened the door to a country where around a third of contracted staff are on the lowest wage possible.    </p>    <p>     Behind this move were large multinationals. According to Petru Dandea and other union leaders, major corporate lobbying groups in Romania, the Foreign Investors Council (FIC) and the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham)     <a href=\\\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4175675-AMCHAM-LETTER.html\\\">      had been relentlessly lobbying     </a>     for a more flexible labour market since 2002 - well before the crash.    </p>    <p>     But AmCham is proud to see the law move in a direction more favourable to its members. Today the group\\u2019s spokesperson Andreea Roma believes that the new code \\u201chas had a positive impact on Romania\\u2019s economic growth\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Meanwhile the Foreign Investors Council (FIC) also admits that it was instrumental in proposing the new changes. It took part in \\u201cover 20 meetings with officials and other organisations\\u201d to discuss the 2011 Labour Code and policy on Social Dialogue, according to spokesman Radu Burnete.    </p>    <p>     The group submitted their labour-related proposals for the Government\\u2019s consideration in 2010. Among their requests, they asked officials to facilitate short-term hire, particularly temporary and zero-hour contracts.    </p>    <p>     This would allow companies to avoid full or part-time employment commitment and commission work for brief periods.    </p>    <p>     In other words, companies would not need contracts with their staff, and they could hire workers by text message the day before with the number of work hours available - this could be eight, or it could be zero.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed \\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/stories/public/img/articles/romania-worker-sell-out/4dandea.jpg\\\"/>    </div>    <div class=\\\"caption\\\">     <p>      Workers\\u2019 rights to bargain for wage rises \\u201csmashed\\u201d by new law, Petru Dandea, union leader     </p>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     European Commission: interference without the right?    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The collective bargaining system was \\u201csmashed\\u201d due to the new law, complains Petru Dandea. Since 2011, four-fifths of all wage negotiations held at company level have been concluded without legitimate workers' representatives, he argues.    </p>    <p>     Now close to a third of the workforce receive the minimum wage - 1,846,498, if registered freelancers are included. \\u201cWe are paid as if we were a country of unqualified workers,\\u201d complains the trade unionist.    </p>    <p>     The European Commission encouraged this practice. In 2012, a new government in Bucharest announced that it would undo the reforms and make country-wide collective agreements possible again. Officials for Olli Rehn - then EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs - together with the IMF,     <a href=\\\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4175676-EC-IMF-Letter-Against-Revions-of-Labor-Law-Oct.html\\\">      attacked the proposal     </a>     .    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWe strongly urge the authorities to ensure that national wage agreements do not contain elements related to wages and/or reverse the progress achieved in the labour code in 2011,\\u201d they wrote to the government. The American Chamber of Commerce issued a similar letter of protest. The \\u2018troika\\u2019 lenders also called on officials not to introduce annual collective bargaining. The government gave up the plan.    </p>    <p>     With this intervention, Rehn and his officials staked a claim to a right to which they were not entitled.     <a href=\\\"http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-x-social-policy/420-article-153.html\\\">      Article 153 of the EU\\u2019s Lisbon Treaty     </a>     , which describes the tasks of the Union regarding social policy and work standards, states that the EU and its agencies have no competence to regulate wages. In the letter above, Rehn\\u2019s officials only \\u2018strongly urge\\u2019 - the text of which means \\u2018we are not telling you to do this\\u2019, the subtext of which most would understand to mean \\u2018we are telling you to do this\\u2019.    </p>    <p>     In practise, the Commission was more intrusive, argue witnesses. The leader of Romania\\u2019s National Union Bloc (Blocul National Sindical - BNS) Dumitru Costin, who was also part of many negotiations with Romania\\u2019s \\u2018troika\\u2019 lenders, confirmed that the European Commission discussed setting wages.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cOf course wage-setting was discussed! The only wage-setting topic the Commission is interested in is the mechanism behind establishing the national minimum wage,\\u201d says Costin.    </p>    <p>     Costin and Dandea say that during Romania\\u2019s meetings with the \\u2018Troika\\u2019 lenders, the Commission did not oppose the business lobbyists\\u2019 suggestions on how laws on workers\\u2019 rights should change. \\u201cThey were accomplices,\\u201d argues Costin.    </p>    <p>     We approached Rehn, who is today a member of the board of the Finnish Central Bank, but he declined to be interviewed on these meddling allegations with the labour reforms of other countries, and whether the EU was acting outside of its jurisdiction.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Right to Fight Back Attacked    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     Want to form a union in Romania?    </p>    <p>     It should be easy.    </p>    <p>     The Romanian Constitution says \\u201cCitizens may freely associate into political parties, trade unions, employers' associations, and other forms of association\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     And this has international confirmation.    </p>    <p>     The European Convention of Human Rights gives workers \\u201cthe right to form trade unions for the protection of members' interests\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     But these two legal obstacles did not get in the way of Romania\\u2019s labour reform.    </p>    <p>     Before 2011, a minimum of 15 people from the same profession, working for different employers within the same industry could form a union.    </p>    <p>     The new Social Dialogue Act from 2011 said those 15 now needed to work for the same company, and they cannot include freelancers.    </p>    <p>     But even if workers can form a union, it could be powerless. If a union wants the recognition to bargain for higher wages within a firm, it must have a membership of 50 per cent plus one of all employees in that company - and big retailers in Romania employ upwards of 15,000. This is a vast number for a union to enlist.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cEvery year, the bargaining power of workers is diminishing and you get into a situation where roughly half of the persons get or end up with the minimum wage,\\u201d says Stephan Meuser.    </p>    <p>     Romanian unions accuse the then-Boc Government of passing policy that barred their access to the negotiating table, leaving employees in precarious situations.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cI call it the Anti-Social Dialogue Act,\\u201d says Retail Union Federation president Vasile Gogescu. \\u201cIt was passed to almost dissolve the collective bargaining contract.\\u201d    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     No protection for vast majority of shop-workers    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The numbers quoted by unions paint a grim picture of the impact of 2011\\u2019s Social Dialog Act.    </p>    <p>     This has hit the boom sectors of shops and warehouses.    </p>    <p>     There are at least 800,000 employees in Romania\\u2019s retail sector, which has been key in the last three years to fuelling the country\\u2019s consumer-led growth.    </p>    <p>     Of these, over 600,000 work for companies with fewer than 15 members of staff, according to Gogescu.    </p>    <p>     This means three-quarters of some of Romania\\u2019s most vulnerable workers cannot have access to union protection.    </p>    <p>     Workers also have little control over their job requirements. \\u201cCountless tasks and responsibilities are piling up,\\u201d says Gogescu, \\u201cand contracts [stipulating the requirements of the job] end with the sentence \\u2018And any other assignment designated by the line manager\\u2019.

This reveals a huge number deprived of protection from a collectively-bargained contract.    </p>    <p>     The association\\u2019s president Rodica Novac says the Social Dialogue policy was passed without any assessment of its public impact, or consideration of the realities of Romania\\u2019s labour market.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cThere are companies who don\\u2019t favour the unionisation of their workers,\\u201d argues Novac. \\u201cJapanese companies, for instance, are straightforward about it.

For two years, a chain of migrants unceasingly walked in front of his house.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cThey were so many that one morning I found a man camping in my garden,\\u201d says Piero. \\u201cHe was shouting \\u2018Ghana! Ghana!\\u2019.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     In mid-2015, Hungary erected a double razor wire fence to prevent the inflow from Serbia to Hungary. Everyone who tries to cross the border now must face the fearsome Hungarian police.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cJust let them through,\\u201d says Piero, \\u201cthey have no intention of staying in Serbia or Hungary. They want to go where the quality of life is good, like in Germany.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Now the wave is no longer so strong. By November 2016, the Hungarian government \\u2013 led by Prime Minister Victor Orb\\u00e0n - limited the number of refugees coming into his country to 25 per week.    </p>    <p>     Therefore Serbia became a huge temporary camp for thousands. This translated \\u2013 both in the city of Subotica and Belgrade - into the creation of improvised shelters in city centers, woods and abandoned factories.    </p>    <p>     But the authorities broke apart many of these makeshift camps. Now any refugee wishing to enter Hungary must wait in the Serbian government camps in the suburbs of cities around the country. These host around 5,400 among refugees, asylum seekers and people in transit, according to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).    </p>    <p>     The migration flow stirred up conflicting reactions among people living in the Serbian regions most affected - confusion, fear and close-mindedness, but also solidarity and support.    </p>    <p>     This is because many Serbians remember experiencing a deluge of migration less than a generation before.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed larger\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" class='\\\"larger\\\"' src=\\\"/stories/public/img/articles/second-to-last-serbia-migrants/2-migrants-belgrade-station.jpg\\\"/>    </div>    <div class=\\\"caption\\\">     <p>      Migrants sleeping rough in Belgrade train station     </p>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     \\u201cWe can see ourselves in these people\\u201d    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     \\u201cThis new humanitarian crisis forced us see ourselves in these people,\\u201d says Sa\\u0161a Gravorac, president of the Serbian Societies of Northern Ba\\u010dka, an association, which provided food and clothing to refugees in 2015 in Subotica. \\u201cWe can really understand their suffering, because of what we went through in the 1990s.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     In 1991, Croatia\\u2019s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia was one of the triggers for a spiral of conflicts, which resulted in a civil war. The Croatian separatists relegated the status of the Serbian community to a minority. This was especially severe on regions such as Krajina, which were populated by a large Serbian community. Many here self-proclaimed the Republic of the Serbian Krajina, which led to a military response from Zagreb.    </p>    <p>     In 1995 Operation Storm (Oluja) forced more than 200,000 Serbs to leave Krajina and head to Serbia, were they became refugees.    </p>    <p>     Gravorac\\u2019s recent message of solidarity gained some exposure after the local newspaper Suboti\\u010dke Novine reported that the Serbian Societies had sent a document to Aleksandar Vulin, Serbian minister of Social Policy.    </p>    <p>     The association was asking the Minister to submit a proposal to his counterpart in Croatia: to reassign the houses on the territory that had once belonged to the Serbians who fled the country during Operation Storm to Middle-Eastern refugees.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWe are willing to hand over the keys of our empty houses simply to help these people,\\u201d commented Gravorac at the time.    </p>    <p>     The project did not happen - but the symbolic connection between the two migrations shed light on an unresolved social issue in both Subotica and Serbia: the social and housing conditions of Serbian refugees from Croatia.    </p>    <p>     Many have been denied a residency permit to go back to their houses in Croatia, and were not able to sell their properties. This situation benefited from an uncontrolled private market of real-estate middlemen who, through a series of favors and corrupt practices with the Croatian authorities, purchased the properties without informing or sharing the profit with the rightful owners.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cThe war ended in 1995 but the souls of the Serbians who migrated here still bear its mark,\\u201d says Gravorac. \\u201cSome refugees managed to become integrated in the community, but many still struggle.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Many Serbian refugees are still living in refugee camps built in the 1990s.

The urban landscape of the Serbian capital is replaced by the Danube woods and industrial compounds, appearing through the forest.    </p>    <p>     Some of these, which date from a time when Yugoslavia was still united, are still active, others are shut-down. The Krnja\\u010da refugee camp was built as a village for workers and employees of the Ivan Milutinovi\\u0107-PIM, a national factory from the 1950s that manufactured harbor infrastructure, until it went bankrupt.    </p>    <p>     When we reach the entrance gate, an informal-looking guard checks our passports and escorts us to the Commissariat for Refugees and Migration, a government agency responsible for managing the refugee and migrant camps. We walk on narrow concrete streets connecting around twenty white prefabricated small units, which are used as dorms and rooms for education and recreation.    </p>    <p>     In 1993 Krnja\\u010da became one of the 700 collective centers set up to shelter Serbians fleeing from the war in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. There are now five active collective centers in Serbia, and the total number of refugees still living in these structures is 153.    </p>    <p>     Ms. Zorica, who worked at PIM for 30 years, also recalls when the refugees from Croatia and Bosnia first arrived at the camp. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been taking in their sufferings for 23 years,\\u201d she says.    </p>    <p>     Zorica explains that many migrants coming from Bosnia were able to sell their houses and buy new ones in Serbia, whereas Serbs coming from Croatia were transferred directly to social housing.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cIn the past few years they were reluctant to speak to reporters,\\u201d she adds. \\u201cThey were mad. They have been living in the camp for 20 years!\\u201d    </p>    <p>     From Zorica\\u2019s office we see children playing outside. Part of the 900 refugees living in the camp today, they are not Serbian, but mostly Afghans, and also Syrians, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurds. They are waiting their turn to get onto the weekly list of 25 who pass through Hungary.    </p>    <p>     Zorica recalls the last months of 2016, when this new unusual cohabitation between the new migrants and the old Serbian refugees began.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cIn the beginning, they were living in separate areas of the camp and there was some mutual mistrust,\\u201d she says. \\u201cAfter some time, they started realizing they were living in the same conditions and they became friends.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     The Serbian government issued a directive to expel all Serbian refugees from these collective centers some time ago, but in the past year this has been accelerated.    </p>    <p>     Krnja\\u010da is now one of the largest refugee camps, the so-called asylum centers. As Serbian accession to the EU becomes more likely, there is pressure from Brussels to resolve this issue, together with cash. The EU has allocated seven million Euro to renovate the camps and make them suitable to receive new migrants from outside Europe, but also to support social and housing assistance for Serbian refugees leaving the camps.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed larger\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" class='\\\"larger\\\"' src=\\\"/stories/public/img/articles/second-to-last-serbia-migrants/4-cricket.jpg\\\"/>    </div>    <div class=\\\"caption\\\">     <p>      Cricket in Serbia: migrants at play in Krnja\\u010da     </p>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The camp is now studded with flags and banners thanking the EU, the charities and international NGOs which funded the camp\\u2019s makeover.

The camp, owned by the Serbian Red Cross, was built in 1993 when 18,000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia arrived in the \\u0160abac province.    </p>    <p>     Between the village and the open fields are ten small white houses: eight are two-unit houses, one is a kitchen and common room, and the last one is the director\\u2019s office. The narrow gravel road crosses a small lawn, leading to the houses and a little playground.    </p>    <p>     Slavko - from the \\u0160abac Red Cross - and Daniel welcome us to the camp. Daniel is 34, he fled from Croatia and has been living in the camp since 1998. He tells us about Zagreb, where he used to live with his family.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cIn my old building, 95 per cent of the people were Croatian, the so-called usta\\u0161a,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThey used to come knocking on our doors saying \\u201c\\u010detnici, we\\u2019ll slit your throat tonight!\\u201d\\u201d    </p>    <p>     He ran away to Serbia in 1995 with his whole family, along with many others. His life changed and is now stained with anger and bitterness: \\u201c70 per cent of Serbians working abroad stayed in west Europe, sitting on their hands; now they live like kings, while I\\u2019m still here.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     In 1998, he requested to move into the Varna camp. In the following years, Daniel and his family lost both their house and their right to return to Croatia. Today, he doesn\\u2019t want to live in the camp, which he views as a place of isolation and a symbol of social stigma: \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t able to finish school. I used to get bullied and beaten by other students every morning because I was a refugee coming from Croatia.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Other residents ask us to write about their need to get rid of their stigma: their condition of refugees still living in a camp, who are portrayed as slackers, taking advantage of the state\\u2019s resources.    </p>    <p>     But they are not absorbing huge benefits. They can only receive assistance from the province where they\\u2019ve been registered. They also do not have full rights. They cannot vote in either Serbia or Croatia, which is contradictory. They have the right to double citizenship, and the resulting identity cards - but if they exercised this right, they would lose their refugee status and, thus, the social protection of the state.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cAround this time last year, there were 80 people in the camp. Some of them were granted apartments, but the ones who stayed are the most vulnerable,\\u201d says Slavko. The families are now fighting to make their voice heard. They want to leave the camp and move into real houses, but in reasonable conditions.    </p>    <p>     The political pressure to shut down the camp is strong. The residents have been asked to sign an agreement to move to the new projects, including 17 prefabs with 36 small apartments, whose total cost amounts to 275,000 Euro. The leading organization in this project is the Serbian NGO Housing Center, which will work alongside the non-profit Initiative for Development and Cooperation (IDC), the city of \\u0160abac and the Commissariat for Refugees and Migration. However, the early agreements have not been honored and the quality of the promised solutions keep falling, which seems to be the reason behind the residents\\u2019 protest.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWith no warning whatsoever, they\\u2019ve relocated the project 3.5 km outside the city, in the middle of the countryside,\\u201d says one refugee. \\u201cThe purchasing conditions have changed: higher prices for smaller and lower-quality apartments\\u201d. The Varna families\\u2019 representatives are furious: \\u201cWe\\u2019re supposed to pay 150 Euro per square meter to live in container-like prefabs with tinfoil roofs!\\u201d adds another.    </p>    <p>     They feel isolated.

Lauritano holds no medical qualifications. His degree in homeopathy is not formally recognised, having been granted by the since-closed Clayton College of Natural Health in Alabama, a non-accredited, distance-learning college specialising in \\u2018alternative medicine\\u2019.    </p>    <p>     The Ebola project was to be financed by the World Bank and UN, according to Toriello, and the billion-dollar contract would be awarded to the Nevada-based The Pintus Group.    </p>    <p>     Subsequent investigation by the authors reveals that the man behind this company was another Italian, Curio Pintus, a convicted money launderer who had shifted half a billion dollars of narco-cash belonging to the Calabria-based mafia group, \\u2018ndrangheta. After spending three years in prison in Italy, Pintus     <a href=\\\"http://expresso.sapo.pt/internacional/2016-07-09-Brincar-com-o-ebola\\\">      had moved his operations to the U.S     </a>     .    </p>    <p>     The investigation also exposed how Lauritano and Toriello conspired to hand the lucrative contract to Pintus without any public tender - a move that later forced the UN to kill the initiative.    </p>    <p>     While researching the story, we met with Toriello at a restaurant in London during the Christmas holidays of 2015.

As is the usual custom, his diplomats and cabinet ministers departed with him.    </p>    <p>     Around this time the Italian police probe began investigating their connections to the Mob and their potential involvement in criminal activities - such as trying to use a diplomatic cover to smuggle cocaine.    </p>    <p>     Transcripts of police wiretaps of conversations between Lauritano and Toriello paint a picture of the duo as smugglers who were well-connected, but incompetent.    </p>    <p>     One of the conversations allegedly took place in November, months after Toriello is supposed to have been fired. The topic is cocaine. Specifically, the transport of up to 120 kilos from Ecuador to Europe in league with the Camorra.    </p>    <p>     According to the indictment, on 17 November, Lauritano travels to Ecuador for a five-day trip set-up the deal, staying first in the country\\u2019s capital, Quito, and then the small, southern town of Santa Rosa. At this stage, Toriello stays away.    </p>    <p>     The plan, worked out between Toriello and the Camorra brokers, is to hide between 70 and 120 kilos of coke in \\u2018diplomatic suitcases\\u2019. This is luggage designed and adapted with sheets of lead to hide the illicit contents. Toriello will waltz the baggage through customs and bypass the security gates, flashing his \\u2018diplomatic immunity\\u2019 as proof he is untouchable.    </p>    <p>     But the deal soon begins to crumble. The Camorra buyers no longer want to commit to such a heavy amount. Instead, they ask for 30 kilos - and agree to pay 500,000 Euro. The Colombians aren\\u2019t happy, but agree. The cocaine will be delivered by the 27 November, they say.    </p>    <p>     On Monday 21st, Lauritano flies home to Italy and waits. He complains to 44-year old, Cristian Neri, drug broker for the Camorra and one of the architects of the plan, that they \\u201cmust give me [the] 500,000 Euro\\u201d fee originally agreed, regardless of the shipment size.    </p>    <p>     For over a week the cocaine sits in an apartment in Quito, waiting for Toriello to come to Ecuador and collect it. Now, the Camorra are not happy - and Neri begins to threaten Lauritano.    </p>    <p>     Ten days later on 7 December, Lauritano and Toriello discuss the deal. Instead of half a million, the pair agree to 240,000 Euro, if Toriello can fly to Ecuador before Christmas and fly out the coke back in a smaller \\u201cdiplomatic briefcase\\u201d. But it is not so simple, Toriello complains. His travel is determined by the S\\u00e3o Tom\\u00e9an UN mission, and so can\\u2019t be scheduled at the time he wants.    </p>    <p>     In the end, Toriello never makes the trip and the deal falls apart, leaving Lauritano owing 50,000 Euro to the Camorra.    </p>    <p>     If Toriello ever planned to make the trip, the affair raises questions about how he could smuggle cocaine using his \\u2018diplomatic cover\\u2019 months after he supposedly left his job.    </p>    <p>     Alc\\u00ednio Cravid e Silva, the new chief of staff for the S\\u00e3o Tom\\u00e9an Foreign Ministry, and main contact for UN diplomatic services, told The Black Sea that he believes Toriello was fired and lost his official credentials when the new President came into power in August last year.    </p>    <p>     While the Italian police believe he retained some ambassadorial benefits, they could not provide evidence. Neither e Silva nor the country\\u2019s new Foreign Minister, Urbino Botelho, gave an official date of Toriello\\u2019s departure, nor could they answer how he and Lauritano remained able to advertise their diplomatic status to the Camorra for international drug deals.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed larger\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" class='\\\"larger\\\"' src=\\\"/stories/public/img/articles/the-mafia-ambassador/6_ambassador.jpg\\\"/>    </div>    <div class=\\\"caption\\\">     <p>      Glory days: Ex-Friar Toriello becomes S\\u00e3o Tom\\u00e9 and Pr\\u00edncipe Ambassador     </p>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     New Venture: Handguns for the Mafia    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     While the cocaine deal was falling apart in December, Toriello hears the Camorra are after weaponry. He has another money-making idea.    </p>    <p>     According to wiretaps, Toriello pushed Lauritano to offer two men from the Camorra, named the \\u2018Two Gennys\\u2019, \\u2018big quantities\\u2019 of weapons he has for sale: specifically, up to 15 kits made up of 7mm Penna handguns, ammunition, and vests. The cost: 70,000 Euro per kit.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cYou have to tell [the contact] that the delivery times have to be flexible,\\u201d Toriello says on tape. \\u201cThe delivery time could be one week or 45 days,\\u201d he adds, before explaining that the \\u201cmerchandise\\u201d would be bought and \\u201csent to the Government\\u201d first, and then to Toriello.    </p>    <p>     But the guns will be clean, says Toriello, because they will come from the government of S\\u00e3o Tom\\u00e9.    </p>    <p>     S\\u00e3o Tom\\u00e9an officials would not respond to questions about how one of its ex-diplomats allegedly offered to sell their weapons to a violent mafia group.    </p>    <p>     Though the two Italian would-be-players\\u2019 illicit deals failed, they had a third crack at the big time: a consignment of nearly a tonne of marijuana and hashish from Morocco.    </p>    <p>     The buyer in the deal is again the Camorra in Naples, and the middleman is again Cristan Neri.    </p>    <p>     Early on in the discussions, according to the wiretaps, the gang\\u2019s drug contact in Morocco says they can go as high as 30 tonnes per deal. This time, however, they are only prepared to sell 900 kilo - as a test.    </p>    <p>     On 16 December, Lauritano contacts the supplier about the shipment. \\u201cWe need to move this 900 kilos... as soon as we can,\\u201d he says. \\u201cFor the payment,\\u201d he adds, \\u201cdoes [your Moroccan partner] agree to receive the first half at the beginning and the second one at the end?\\u201d    </p>    <p>     Apparently, the partner didn\\u2019t agree with splitting the fee.    </p>    <p>     Instead, over the next months, Lauritano acts as a mule for the two Gennys, who run a monopoly on the sale of \\u2018amn\\u00e9sia\\u2019 marijuana in Naples. He transports their potent puff from a loft in Amsterdam back to Naples by car - and sometimes Toriello joins him for the ride.    </p>    <p>     But Toriello appears less than committed to the trafficking cause. During a trip from the Netherlands to bring the stash he complains about his financial difficulties and family problems. He tells Lauritano he must go back and deliver 2,000 Euro to his wife and two children, who live in London.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Secret of Dodgy Appointment Revealed    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The wiretap evidence collected in these months also sheds light on how Toriello, an Italian lacking any political experience, and with fake degrees and legal troubles, could have been installed as senior diplomat for a country he had never even visited.    </p>    <p>     It suggests that Lauritano was a key player in this charade, paying Toriello a monthly fee of 5,000 Euro, and, in return, the former Franciscan Friar hired Lauritano as his coordinator.    </p>    <p>     Speaking with Cristian Neri, the drug broker, on 16 December 2016, Toriello said that he is in \\u2018a project\\u2019 with Lauritano, that the two of them play \\u2018roles\\u2019 and implies that Lauritano is in charge.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cDo you know why I have a diplomatic rank?\\u201d he says. \\u201cI tell you the truth.

The shameless self-promoter remains quiet, and it is believed he is staying with his family in London.    </p>    <p>     At the beginning of July, Toriello takes a flight from the UK to Italy to visit his parents in Mercato San Severino. The move surprised the police - who assumed that with Lauritano in jail and talking to the cops, Toriello would not enter Italy and risk his freedom.    </p>    <p>     When the \\u2018Operation Santa Lucia\\u2019 raids are carried out across Europe on 5 July, Toriello is among those arrested, grabbed at his parents\\u2019 home.    </p>    <p>     Among his possessions, they find his identification card for the UN headquarters in New York - a symbol of Toriello\\u2019s four years at the senior table in the hub of global diplomacy.    </p>    <p>     One big question remains unanswered: was he invited by the President, the mob, or both?    </p>    <p>     <br/>    </p>    <p>     <br/>    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"ed836343-a55a-4533-a1ee-666f2f7803f3\"}]"}, "pk": 2029, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

The president\\u2019s younger daughter, then 26, is described as a nightclubber, driving every night at the wheel of her Porsche Cayenne, to the most chic venue in Tashkent. The cable says that she drank alcohol and \\u201cdanced freely\\u201d until the end of the night with her \\u201cthuggish-looking\\u201d boyfriend and future husband Timur Tillyaev, an owner of bars and restaurants in the capital of the Muslim-majority country.    </p>    <p>     In 2006, Lola Karimova left Uzbekistan and settled briefly in Riga, Latvia. With her husband, she moved to Paris and to Switzerland, where they bought a 30 million Euro property in 2010 in the poshest suburb of Geneva. Three years later, Timur and Lola purchased a mega-villa worth around 50 million dollars in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles.    </p>    <p>     In a recent interview for a puff piece in Vanity Fair promoting her perfume brand, Lola says that she shares her time between her main LA residence and Paris, where she works for her perfume company and as an ambassador of Uzbekistan to Unesco, a post she held from 2008 and is likely to relinquish soon. She also runs several charities, like the \\u2018You Are Not Alone Foundation\\u2019, which supports Uzbek orphans.    </p>    <p>     A pillar of Parisian social life, Karimova works to improve the image of the Uzbek regime, which is most notable in the international press for the \\u2018Andijan Massacre\\u2019 of 2005 - where its security services fired on a peaceful protest, killing hundreds of demonstrators, before burying them in mass graves. The authorities also had a penchant for     <a href=\\\"https://www.rferl.org/a/uzbekistans-house-of-torture/24667200.html\\\">      boiling alive their prisoners     </a>     .    </p>    <p>     Accessing Parisian high society does not come cheap.

He entrusted the management to fellow Uzbek collaborator Alimbekov Dovronbek, an engineer and champion of Uzbek martial arts.    </p>    <p>     Here we detail a chain of businesses in multiple jurisdictions: Securtrade buys products in China or Turkey, then sells them to other trading companies, which sell them to Scottish shell companies, which further sell them on to the merchants of Abu Sahiy market.    </p>    <p>     Documents obtained by EIC suggest that this scheme is shady. First, there are the stupendous profits of Securtrade.    </p>    <p>     Its bank records for 2013 and 2014 show that the company achieved, over this period, a minimum of 127 million USD in profit on a turnover of 151 million USD.    </p>    <p>     That makes a hallucinatory net gain of 85 per cent, which seems out of reach for a company that sells low margin products such as TV sets and clothes.    </p>    <p>     Some of this money has financed the couple's activities and personal expenses. 12 million USD was wired to Silk Road International, a company in Brunei which owns the couple\\u2019s Airbus A300 cargo plane. Securtrade also paid 1.2 million USD to Vertfort LCC, the American company that owns the couple's villa in Beverly Hills, and 675,000 USD to Harmonist Inc., the U.S. company operating Lola's Harmonist boutique in Los Angeles.    </p>    <p>     The remaining cash, 113 million USD, has remained in the company\\u2019s accounts at Mashreq Bank in Dubai, and at NBAD Bank in Abu Dhabi, while 20 million USD has been transferred to an account at the Swiss bank Vontobel, through a Swiss assets management company called CPCI.    </p>    <p>     Because this is complicated, here is a diagram that sets this out:    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-image-embed \\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <div class=\\\"image\\\">     <img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/stories/public/img/articles/uzbekistan-lola-karimova-business/securtrad_en.jpg\\\"/>    </div>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The question remains: how can Securtrade achieve such huge profitability?    </p>    <p>     Well, it seems that this Dubai company of Timur Tillyaev sells products, but rarely buys them.    </p>    <p>     In its 2013 and 2014 bank records, there are 151 million USD of sales, but only eight million identified as payments to suppliers, almost twenty times fewer.    </p>    <p>     In its annual financial statements, Securtrade states it has bought 92 million USD worth of products during the same period, but adds that it accumulated a trading debt of 79 million USD owed to its suppliers at the end of 2014.    </p>    <p>     This means that Securtrade only paid out 13 million USD from 92 million. Financial experts say that a seller in such a transaction would not put up with owing such a high debt to a client, as these payments are usually cleared in a maximum of three months.    </p>    <p>     So this raises a doubt about the reality of these business deals - an issue which Timur and Lola\\u2019s lawyer refused to explain publicly.

The company makes almost all of its sales with shell corporations that have no offices or employees.    </p>    <p>     At the top of the chain, Securtrade\\u2019s final customers are, according to Tillyaev\\u2019s lawyer, traders who sell goods to \\u201cvendors at Abu Sahiy and other markets\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     But all these merchants keen to work in Central Asia have - bizarrely - chosen to set up their businesses in Scotland, more than 5,000 kilometres from Tashkent.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     Uzbek Trading Hotspot: A Village in South Lanarkshire    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     The three trading customers of Securtrade are named Elcorp, Five Star Technology Support, and Greenhall Management.    </p>    <p>     These are \\u2018Scottish Limited Partnerships\\u2019, a controversial status that allows them to keep the secrecy of the owners with the same lack of transparency as the most notorious tax havens, but with the respectable facade of a British company.    </p>    <p>     Securtrade\\u2019s final customers are based in a room in a central Edinburgh block, and a townhouse in the village of Douglas, in the county of South Lanarkshire.

Gruhn's spokesman says that Titan \\u201chas now been dormant for nearly two years\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     Patrick Gruhn has also lent, through Titan Traders, 350,000 Euro to the French company which manages the Paris boutique The Harmonist, the perfume brand of Lola Karimova, located on the exclusive George V Avenue near the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es.

Then Securtrade sold the goods for nine million USD to Titan, which resold them to Scottish shell company Five Star.    </p>    <p>     But the documents obtained by EIC suggest that there could be no real trading of goods behind this money flow. In most cases Titan resells the clothes to Five Star, before it even buys them.    </p>    <p>     Invoices issued by the Chinese supplier to Securtrade do not have a company header or signature. One of the Xinjiang Bortala invoices mentions the resale of the products by Securtrade to Titan, on a date which happens two weeks after the date written on its invoice. In other words, it reports a sale which happens in the future.    </p>    <p>     The clothes have been shipped by trucks from China to the Abu Sahiy market in Tashkent. But there are problems with the transport documents. They have the stamp of the Uzbek customs, but were not filled in correctly: most of the mandatory fields were left blank, including export license numbers, truck departure and arrival dates, and commodity prices.    </p>    <p>     In response, Timur Tillyaev\\u2019s lawyer asserts that Securtrade only carries out \\u201clegitimate, legal transactions of actual goods\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cTo the extent that non-falsified, actual company documents may reveal an error in any one of those transactions, we acknowledge that no company is 100% perfect, and we do not claim that SecurTrade is the exception,\\u201d adds Mark F. Raymond.    </p>    <p>     The activities of Timur Tillyaev in the United Arab Emirates raised suspicion among the authorities. In May 2013, following a denunciation by the central bank, the Sharjah police launched an investigation into Silk Road FZE (one of the companies in Tillyaev\\u2019s business galaxy) on suspicion of money laundering. The two Uzbek managers of the company were questioned and their passports confiscated. But they were eventually allowed to leave the country.    </p>    <p>     A coincidence - On 8 September 2013, the manager of Securtrade, Alimbekov Dovronbek, had the privilege to meet the Sheikh of Sharjah, Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, in his palace.

But it could have been more - especially in Germany.    </p>    <p>     Der Spiegel and journalistic network EIC analyzed dozens of annual reports and documents and found that Volkswagen took advantage of benefits associated with owning a Luxembourg holding, apparently allowing VW to slash its tax bill. This is worrying for a company which is part-owned by the German state of Lower Saxony.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cWhen a company, in which the state is a large stakeholder, takes advantage of Luxembourg tax law to optimize its tax bill, it is particularly troublesome,\\u201d says Sven Giegold, financial expert for the Green Party in the European Parliament.    </p>    <p>     Recently, an aggressive tax approach by U.S. multinational Amazon Group sparked debate on the complex models that multinationals use to shift profits to low-tax countries such as Luxembourg, thus undermining the tax base in nations where they operate.    </p>    <p>     An initiative by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) aimed at limiting such practices has had little effect. EU member states are also slow to mobilize.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cIt is high time that the German federal government abandons its resistance to public tax transparency for large corporations,\\u201d adds Giegold.    </p>    <p>     The Volkswagen Group also used structures in Luxembourg to help a transfer of profits from its group of companies.    </p>    <p>     VW channels the financial flows of brands such as Skoda, Seat and Bentley, as well as its companies in Brazil, Great Britain, Russia, Japan and Australia through its Luxembourg holding company, VFL.    </p>    <p>     Meanwhile VFL has a total of 26 subsidiaries and a balance sheet of 14.8 billion Euro. And how many employees does this multi-billion Luxembourg empire need to operate?    </p>    <p>     A total of five.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cVW and the German government must answer the question as to why such a Luxembourg holding is accepted by [German] tax laws,\\u201d says Giegold. \\u201cIt's rather cute to recognize a company with five employees as sufficient enough to establish a tax home.\\u201d    </p>    <p>     But VW does not believe this is strange.    </p>    <p>     \\u201cThe personnel configuration of our companies in Luxembourg is of high quality and adequate for the task at hand,\\u201d the company says in a statement.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     What kind of money are we talking about here?    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     From 2014 to 2016, VW subsidiaries across the globe have surrendered 5.8 billion Euro to Luxembourg.    </p>    <p>     VFL reported a profit of 3.5 billion Euro over that time, but paid only 1.7 million Euro in tax, equivalent to a rate of 0.05 percent.    </p>    <p>     Although VW firms such as Seat or \\u0160koda pay corporate taxes in Spain or the Czech Republic, for example, they only transfer their net profits to Luxembourg.    </p>    <p>     If such profits went to Germany, five per cent of them would face taxation.

Then VIL passes the interest income as dividends to VFL, which does not pay taxes on it.    </p>    <p>     The bottom line is that the credit and capital relationships in the group mean there are lower profits in the subsidiaries, based in countries where VW has to pay a lot of tax, and larger profits in Luxembourg, where it has to pay less.    </p>    <p>     This is particularly lucrative when there is a huge cash boost. In 2016, the VW Group sold its 50 per cent stake in Dutch-based financing company LeasePlan for around 1.75 billion Euro to an investor consortium.    </p>    <p>     This money was banked in the Luxembourg holding company. In the case of dividends, there is no capital gains tax in Luxembourg, as long as the money remains in the country. In Germany, five per cent of the revenue is taxed, which - in the case of LeasePlan - theoretically would have amounted to around 25 million Euro (our calculations).    </p>    <p>     VW explains that the taxation of companies in Luxembourg is \\u201cbased on legal regulations - anything else wouldn't be allowed\\u201d.    </p>    <p>     There are indications, however, that VW uses a controversial \\u201ctax ruling\\u201d mechanism. This is where a company informs the local tax authorities about its interpretation of their domestic tax laws, and confirms that the locals - in this case Luxembourg - will give authorisation to such a scheme.    </p>    <p>     VW does not deny this possibility.    </p>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-subheadline\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <h2>     How much cash is saved from the German taxman?    </h2>   </div>  </div> </div></section><section class=\\\"content-text\\\"> <div class=\\\"container\\\">  <div class=\\\"row\\\">   <div class=\\\"col-xs-12\\\">    <p>     It is hard to determine how much tax the Group can save with this scheme.
