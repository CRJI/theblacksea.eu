Today they are participating in a public debate. A young Romanian with an American education in a smart shirt tries to smile while the crowd turns restless. He is attempting to convince them that allowing US energy giant Chevron to drill for shale gas in this locality would be good for their village.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But his speech only manages to stir anger and he is soon overwhelmed by yells and boos.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">An old man stands up and speaks, as the crowd cheers him on. &quot;We should be able to vote on whether we agree with this or we don&rsquo;t!&quot; he says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;Sit down!&quot; retorts the President of the County Council, Dumitru Buzatu, grabbing the microphone to restore order. &quot;The Romanian Law says that the underground belongs to the state. And no one will ask what you think!&quot;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A year ago, before the local elections, the same council official stood on a stage and urged thousands of protesters to oppose shale gas.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;I will always be here to say &lsquo;NO&rsquo; to Chevron and &lsquo;NO&rsquo; to drilling,&quot; he said at the time.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But since his reappointment, Buzatu has switched to became a sort of unofficial spokesman for the American multinational, translating corporate lingo into angry bellowing at the very people who elected him.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"pull-right-small pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/pic_one%281%29.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: initial; width: 945px;\\\" />\\u200b</p><div class=\\\"storyCaption\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Switching sides: County council president Dumitru Buzatu arguing with citizens kicked out of a Chevron &quot;town hall meeting&quot; in Vaslui county, east Romania</div><p style=\\\"\\\">This volte-face of views on a controversial subject is happening not only at a local level.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta, newly elected in 2012, has said one of his main objectives is to start drilling for shale gas.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But last year, when he was the head of the opposition, he strongly criticized the Government for the same policy, which he described as &quot;giving away what&rsquo;s left of Romania&rsquo;s resources&quot;.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After winning the elections he called for giving Chevron the right to drill. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m fighting for shale gas and I think I&rsquo;m doing the right thing,&rdquo; he said in an interview in June, after urging his ministers not to be influenced by anti-fracking protests.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"pull-right-small pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/pic_two.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: initial; width: 945px;\\\" />\\u200b</p><div class=\\\"storyCaption\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Turning his back: Victor Ponta receiving the <a _blank=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"http://www.gov.ro/pm-victor-ponta-has-been-awarded-the-tanara-speranta-ecologista-promising-young-environmentalist-prize-at-the-green-awards-2012-gala__l2a117318.html\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Promising Young Environmentalist&rdquo; award</a> in 2012 - before he became an ardent supporter of controversial shale gas and gold mine projects</div><p style=\\\"\\\">Annoyed it has to import expensive natural gas from Russia, Romania&rsquo;s strategy of becoming energy independent will include turning over its resources to American multinationals, starting with Chevron.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Politicians from all the major parties put away their differences after the elections in a joint effort to push for drilling, even though they admit the royalties are small and the potential damage is unknown.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">US companies are happy with Romania&rsquo;s investment climate, as the royalties they will give to the state are low and the regulatory system is light for a controversial extraction technique that involves pumping a high-pressure mix of water and chemicals into the gas-bearing rock, creating tiny cracks and forcing the gas up a cement pipe.</p><div class=\\\"fullwidth_pq\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><div class=\\\"textColumnBig right\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile the Romanian are the most hostile people to fracking in the EU - alongside France, which has banned the process in its territory. Over 70 per cent of Romanians polled expressed total opposition to shale gas development, while the rest argued that they would agree only if better health and environment safeguards were put in place, according to a public consultation by the European Commission.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Many believe that the benefits are too few compared to risks such as the extraction process contaminating the water supply.</p></div><div class=\\\"LeftColumnSmall\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><div class=\\\"pq\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><div class=\\\"pq_container\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><div class=\\\"pq_blue\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><div class=\\\"pq_content\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Royalties that US companies will give to the Romanian state for shale gas exploitation are half the rate the US state receives from the same corporations</div></div></div></div></div></div><p style=\\\"\\\">A <a href=\\\"http://ratingpolitic.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Barometru-ARP-Piata-politica-apr2013-presa.pdf\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> survey </a> conducted in April found that 41.5 per cent of Romanians thought shale gas exploitation was a threat, 21.9 per cent considered it safe, 16 per cent didn&rsquo;t know how to answer and the rest had never heard of it.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Fracking has sparked one of the largest protest movements in Romania, rooted in ecologist feelings and a wide distrust of politicians and government. The communist era saw a forced industrialization that led to many environmental disasters that still plague the country and the people are not convinced that the current political class will be more responsible.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The small town of Barlad in the poor region of east Romania saw the largest protests any of the locals can remember. Not even the anti-communist revolution of 1989 brought so many people out into the streets. Among the five protests in the last year and a half, media reports estimate the largest attendance was 8,000 people in a town of 50,000.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The people of Barlad care about their drinking supply. The town&rsquo;s coat of arms features three fish on a blue background. There are 20 public fountains spewing sulphur-rich water that people consider good for their health. Their tap water comes from reservoirs miles away, which they fear could be contaminated by fracking. During their protests, a typical sign read &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill our water! Don&rsquo;t kill our children!&rdquo;.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Their worries are not just a sentimental reaction. More than half of the country&rsquo;s water resources are already contaminated, according to Romania&rsquo;s National Strategy for Sustainable Development. There are 2,660 cubic meters of water available per capita each year, well below the European average of 4,000 cubic meters. Areas that rely on subsistence farming, such as Barlad, are the most vulnerable to water shortages.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Extracting shale gas requires between 2,000 and 10,000 times more water than conventional gas, <a href=\\\"http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2012/goldenrules/weo2012_goldenrulesreport.pdf\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">according</a> to the International Energy Agency. Each well consumes 500 truckloads of water, about 15,000 cubic meters.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Water is about 99 per cent of the fluid that is injected underground to make tiny cracks in the rock that holds the gas. The rest is a mixture of chemicals.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A <a href=\\\"http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Hydraulic-Fracturing-Chemicals-2011-4-18.pdf\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">report</a> by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce found that &ldquo;between 2005 and 2009, the oil and gas service companies used hydraulic fracturing products containing 29 chemicals that are known or possible human carcinogens, regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act for their risks to human health, or listed as hazardous air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Although they represent only one per cent of the fluid, this still amounts to about 150 tons of chemicals for each well.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">An <a href=\\\"http://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/drilling/\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">investigation</a> by the National Public Radio in the U.S. in 2012 examined the records of 8,982 fracking wells in Pennsylvania and found 3,025 violations reported by the Department of Environmental Protection in a 2.5-year interval. That means one violation for every three wells.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Not all transgressions resulted in contaminated water. There were 143 cases of &ldquo;Discharge of pollutional material to waters of the Commonwealth&rdquo;, 90 cases of &ldquo;Failure to properly control or dispose of industrial or residual waste to prevent pollution of the waters of the Commonwealth&rdquo;, 44 cases of &ldquo;Improper casing to protect fresh groundwater&rdquo; and other violations.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The recorded violations of legal requirements amount to about one to two per cent of all drilling permits. Many of these accidents are due to improper handling or leaking equipments,&rdquo; stated a 2011 <a href=\\\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201107/20110715ATT24183/20110715ATT24183EN.pdf\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">report</a> by the European Parliament.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The land required by drilling is also a challenge: unlike conventional gas, exploiting shale gas requires a large area of tightly spaced wells to be profitable. The drilling density can exceed one well per 60 acres, states a <a href=\\\"http://www.3legsresources.com/media/A%20guide%20to%20shale%20gas.pdf\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">report</a> by 3legs Resources, an independent oil and gas company with leases in Poland.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">There is a strong feeling among Romanians that they are victims of history, forever trapped on the outskirts of empires and exploited like a colony. The current system of taxes and royalties does not help to dismiss these worries.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The royalties for shale gas extraction in Romania are among the lowest in Europe and none of them will reach local communities. The money will instead go to the state budget of a country still facing tough EU monitoring of its legacy of corruption at a national level.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The current system of leasing and payment of a royalty has not been proven to be advantageous,&rdquo; says Gheorghe Manea, an economist who studied development strategies for the Romanian Academy. &ldquo;The total revenue from royalties is insignificant for the state budget.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Romania&rsquo;s graft level compares to that of Saudi Arabia, according to Transparency International, so few expect that the royalties will be efficiently used.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The energy companies must pay between 3.5 and 13 per cent of the value of the gas they extract, depending on the output, plus a 16 per cent income tax. This adds up to 19.5 to 29 per cent from the revenue.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the U.S., companies must pay over twice this figure - between 47.5 and 65 per cent, plus initial bonuses for the landowners. In Norway this rate is 78 per cent.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However there are voices in Romania who claim this level is too high. Alexandru Patruti, the former head of the Romanian Mineral Resources Agency, which signed the contracts with Chevron, claimed that the royalties should be even lower, because the technical process of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling is more complicated than a conventional operation.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We have these small royalties because they were established at a time when all the companies were state-run, and the state didn&rsquo;t care [about how much it was receiving],&rdquo; says Ana Otilia Nutu, energy analyst at Bucharest-based think tank Expert Forum.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Prime Minister Ponta has said he plans to increase the royalties in 2014. But it is unclear how the 30-year contract with Chevron can be changed retroactively. Several lawyers, as well as Government employees, have mixed opinions on whether such amendments are possible.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ultimately a political negotiation,&rdquo; said one lawyer who asked not to be named, for fear of being associated with the Chevron contracts.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In Poland, the Government tried to increase the shale gas taxes to 40 per cent - a still lower rate than the amount western countries charge. But the companies protested. US energy giant Exxon sold its Polish leases, while Chevron threatened to do the same, so the authorities dropped the tax increase.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"pull-right-small pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/pic_six.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: initial; width: 945px;\\\" />\\u200b</p><div class=\\\"storyCaption\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Eco-activist: Anti-fracking Protester in Barlad, March 2012</div><p style=\\\"\\\">The politicians&rsquo; main argument for promoting shale gas is that it will help the country towards energy independence from Russia. Romania produces three quarters of its gas needs and imports the rest from Russia at a high price. The Romanians are not satisfied with this deal and are historically distrustful towards their eastern neighbor.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;I&rsquo;m not in a war with Russia, but I want my country to depend as little as possible on gas imports,&quot; said Victor Ponta in an <a href=\\\"http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-politic-14081565-interviul-integral-victor-ponta-varianta-audio-video.htm\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">interview</a> with Hotnews.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile the Prime Minister&rsquo;s political arch-enemy, President Traian Basescu, has backed up his fellow leader&rsquo;s point of view.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;We would have to make some concessions to the Russians to lower the price [of gas imports] and I&rsquo;m not ready to make these concessions,&quot; said the President in a recent meeting with his Facebook fans. &quot;Between certain risks and energy independence, I say yes to shale gas, without knowing much about the risks.&quot;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But Romania is one of the least energy dependent countries in Europe. &quot;Energy independence is one of the few areas in which [Romania] can stand tall,&quot; said Iulian Iancu, head of the Economy and Industry Commission in the Chamber of Deputies, in an interview in March.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">While the current gas basins will be depleted in 20 years, Romania still has plenty of natural resources it can use in the future. Dobrogea, the hilly region on the Black Sea shore where Chevron acquired shale gas leases, is one of the best places in the world to set up wind farms, according to an Ernst &amp; Young report. The wind farms now active in the region account for around eight per cent of Romania&rsquo;s electrical energy output - from a base of zero five years ago.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">170 kilometers to the east, in the Black Sea, Exxon has partnered with Romanian companies to explore offshore natural gas deposits. The first results estimate one deposit holds about 100 billion cubic meters of gas - enough to fuel Romania for seven years, according to the President of Romania, and there are five more perimeters to be explored.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Romania is also pursuing alternative sources of imported gas from the Caspian Sea region, tapping into Azerbaidjan&rsquo;s rich resources of hydrocarbons through the proposed liquefied natural gas corridor AGRI.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Shale gas is not limited to the four perimeters leased by Chevron. Companies such as the Hungarian energy group MOL have acquired gas leases in Western Romania. The National Mineral Resources Agency denied this lease has any connection with fracking, but some of the companies involved in these contracts have posted on their websites that they intend to drill for shale gas if the conditions are right, which mainly depends on how the deal with Chevron will turn out.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile in Barlad, the people have lost all hope of support from politicians and have instead asked the Church for help.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"pull-right-small pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/pic_seven.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: initial; width: 945px;\\\" />\\u200b</p><div class=\\\"storyCaption\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Invasion fears: Orthodox priest Laiu turns on the anti-foreigner rhetoric in fracking opposition</div><p style=\\\"\\\">Local Orthodox priest Vasile Laiu has become the leader of the protests, shouting rhymes through a megaphone and saying prayers on stage. At the end of one of his sermons, he stands in front of the altar and reads a mesmerizing speech against the &quot;contemporary invaders&quot;:</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;You can make this parallel: an invading army and foreign corporations; enemy chieftains and corporate managers; traitors and lobbyists.&quot;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The people calmly listen to him, grab protest banners and head towards the City Hall, where riot police are already waiting.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The foreign threat has activated the survival instincts of the Romanians and these people are unlikely to give up their resistance. But with the contracts spanning three decades and the Government showing no sign of stepping back, it will be a long fight.</p>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"da1f23e8-a771-403a-bc4d-aef05e7e6f6f\"}]"}, "pk": 1095, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

I walked from one end of the city to the other - back again and then back again once more. If you are in a club and you start dancing on the drug, you can&rsquo;t stop. You can&rsquo;t eat. You can&rsquo;t sleep. My record for not sleeping on the drug was 11 days and nights. At the end of that time, it was like I was hit by a train - all my arms, inner organs, legs, jaws, everything was hurting. Then I slept for at least 48 hours, without waking up.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Desperate for a high, but lacking cash and access to quality narcotics, Moldovan drug users are turning to Vint - a home-made concoction based on ephedrine from cold-and-flu relief tablets, sold at their local pharmacy.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Users mix the drug with iodine and red phosphorus scraped from the sides of matchboxes into a vial to inject inside their veins.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But the conversion of this household remedy into an addictive stimulant can cause bone decay in feet, legs and jaws - risking loss of limbs and fatal consequences.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Party hard</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2007, as a student, Dmitri started cooking up the new drug with friends before they went clubbing.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;When I injected the first time, I had never had such a good feeling,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It is like the soul is leaving the body. Everything is great, everything is beautiful and there are no problems.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">By 2012, Dmitri was taking Vint four times a day. Following a misunderstanding with another user which ended in a fist-fight, he was punched in the jaw. The bone began to hurt and a bruise started to swell in his cheek.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However Dmitri ignored the injury and continued to inject, until the pain was so intense, he visited the hospital.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Analysing an x-ray of the damage, the doctor told Dmitri he had a bone infection called toxic ostoemyelitis, due to the Vint.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The red phosphorus from matchboxes was depositing in his bone tissue, causing mineral poisoning, while the ephedrine from the flu tablets was narrowing the blood vessels, restricting the flow of blood.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Because the lower jaw area is a part of the body sensitive to infection, this two-pronged attack was causing the bone to decay.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The doctor told me if I went on taking drugs, this would get worse,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But after one week I was using again.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Due to his facial bones decaying, pus formed in balls behind his jaw and under his chin. He returned to the hospital and the doctors put a tube into the swelling to drain the fluid.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After the operation, he continued to inject.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Two months later the pain intensified. A gash in the skin emerged just above his chin.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I could breathe through my mouth, my nose and also through this hole in the side of my face,&rdquo; he says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At this point, the seriousness of the problem was starting to become clear to Dmitri.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">An operation was necessary. He went to the clinic accompanied by his mother and pleaded with the doctor, saying he would no longer take vint, swearing that he would &ldquo;never lie in front of Mama&rdquo;.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He stayed in hospital, a cloth wrapped around his jaw to keep his face in place, tanked up on antibiotics.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The doctors told him they had to remove the bone, but the Moldovan national health service does not provide drug users a new jaw for free.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The risk was that without a bone between the chin and the cranium, his tongue could flop back into his throat, suffocating him. Therefore he may need a tracheotomy to breathe.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;When they told me, I was just crying,&rdquo; says Dmitri. &ldquo;I did not understand how I could live.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Saving face</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A Moldova-based NGO run by ex-drug users, Initiativa Pozitiva, gathered together funds from its employees to help pay the 500 dollar cost for a prosthetic implant from Russia.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;When the doctor said he had found me a titanium jaw from Moscow, I was so happy,&rdquo; says Dmitri.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Local surgeons opened the skin around his head from the right side of the chin near the jaw-line, removing the mandible. They replaced this with a 15 cm-long bracket fixed with two joints to the upper and lower parts of the skull.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now the left side of his face is swollen, as though half a football is pushing out from his cheek. But new bone is growing back.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Dmitri has no teeth in the lower jaw, so he can eat only porridge and mashed food. But he can smoke.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">His doctor told him that if he takes a flight, he has to give a letter to the guards at the security gate, informing them of his new jaw because, between the poles of the metal detector, his face will set off the alarm.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Narco drought</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Options for drug users in Moldova are few. Heroin is too expensive and lacks purity. Marijuana does not give a tough enough kick. Meanwhile dealers rarely export cocaine, LSD or Ecstasy to a nation with the status of the poorest in Europe.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">While older users prefer a home-made drug from locally grown poppies, Shirka, young people are looking for a cheap high.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;In Moldova, Vint use has become vogue,&rdquo; says Ruslan Poverga, an ex-drug user now representing NGO collective Initiativa Pozitiva.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Easy-to-make and quick to inject, Vint is an effective stimulant which eliminates the risk of meeting a dealer.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Some users in Chisinau combine the drug with heroin substitute methadone to create a &lsquo;speedball&rsquo; effect of stimulant and depressant. Taxi drivers have also used to the drug to keep awake for 24-hour stretches.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But the cases of jaw loss affected by the drug are piling up.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Natalya Rusu, assistant professor in Chisinau&rsquo;s Maxillofacial surgery at the State University of Medicine and Pharmacy, says she has seen &ldquo;nearly 200 similar&rdquo; cases of bone decay in the face and the legs due to drug abuse.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Different narcotics have different time limits to destroy your body,&rdquo; adds Alexandr Curasov, managing director at Initiativa Pozitiva, &ldquo;and Vint has a short time period.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Fatalities are also common. From his friends, Dmitri has lost six to Vint, either due to damage from bone decay, overdoses or strokes.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">One per cent shoot up</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Wedged between a Russia reasserting its confidence and a European Union tilting towards expansion, Moldova&rsquo;s population is split between those looking for better prospects in the east or west.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Everyone is travelling. Minibuses, cars, buses and trains are packed with workers shifting products, luggage and themselves to and from Moscow, Spain, Italy, Bucharest or Germany.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This is a country in permanent transit from itself. Everything moves but little is grown or built. This tears families apart. Parents who work abroad leave their children in the care of elderly grandparents, while a growing number of teenagers are home alone, funded by cash sent by Mum and Dad through Western Union.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Bored, left in charge of themselves and with money in their pocket, many teenagers are prone to experiment with forbidden substances without adequate safeguards.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Young people with nothing to do are left to themselves and, from having nothing to do, that&rsquo;s when it all starts,&rdquo; says one Chisinau heroin user.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Problem use of Vint, Heroin and Shirka in Moldova is widespread. There are around 31,000 injecting users - about one per cent of the population, estimate local NGOs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Many of these are young people without a career or those abandoned by a nation in constant transition.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Due to this state of flux, steady jobs available in Moldova include driving or working for the Government. But users who seek help through a methadone substitution programme are placed on a &ldquo;narco-registry&rsquo; - a list of &lsquo;official&rsquo; drug addicts, which means they are restricted from working as drivers or for the State.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Other employment is scarce. Dmitri is a graduate in car engineering and design. But in Moldova there are no jobs in his field, because no one builds automobiles.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He wants to work in restyling cars, modernising the motors with new bonnets, lights and bumpers.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I want to make old cars better,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but there is nowhere to do this in Moldova.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Crime drive</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Out of work and lacking a ready income, many users turn to petty crime to fund their habit.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On the main street of the Chisinau, I am about to meet Stefan, a 29 year-old user who has also lost his jaw to Vint, when my contact gets a phone-call saying that he is unavailable. I ask her why. At first she is reluctant to tell me, but then laughs, saying he is with the police.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Later that day the cops release him. We meet and I ask him what happened.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He was eating a sandwich in a cafe when a security guard accosted him, saying he had a video of Stefan stealing a coffee jar from the cafe&rsquo;s shelves.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He showed Stefan the videotape and called the police, who arrested him and threw him in jail.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It was strange because I stole the jar two months ago and I had been eating there many times since,&rdquo; says Stefan. &ldquo;They only just noiticed.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He paid his fine at the police station and they let him go.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Relief from tedium</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">20 year-old Maria has teeth that are orange-yellow and brown, while her gums have traces of black. She wears a red t-shirt emblazoned with the word &lsquo;commandant&rsquo; and her hair is cut short with a fringe tucked over ear.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After taking heroin at 15 and spending her late teenage years addicted to Shirka, she turned to Vint as a cheap alternative.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;This was very easy to make at the flat of my friend&rsquo;s mum, as she had left for Germany,&rdquo; she says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">To fund her habit she would steal jewellery from her parents and shoplift.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">One drug she tried was eye-drop solution Tropicamid, which users inject straight into the vein.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Because Tropicamid was becoming a popular over-the-counter drug for users to abuse, the Government prevented its purchase without a prescription.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But this did not stop users such as Maria.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We had a friend in a hospital who gave us a bunch of prescriptions ready-stamped by a doctor,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We could fill these in with whichever drug we wanted.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Back into society</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now a regular visitor to the Pas cu Pas (Step by Step) drop-in centre in Chisinau that helps addicts to reintegrate into the workplace, Maria is coming around to the idea of giving up drugs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Financed by international donors, the centre is a basement in a Communist block which acts as the frontline against drug abuse by engaging users, without forcing them to renounce their habit.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This is the first step towards bringing a hidden, closed and suspicious community back into society.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At the centre, Maria can meet former addicts, try group therapy and find information on life and work skills.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Because I come here, I do not inject and I have something to do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Here there are former addicts and they understand you. It&rsquo;s different from other people on the street who point at me and say &lsquo;Look at the druggy&rsquo;. Here people know how you feel and if you feel bad they try to make you think about other stuff. I want to find a job.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;If I could work, I would work, then come here and go to my friends. My life would be - Work. Friends. Drop-in centre. That would be enough.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Some user names have been changed.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For a further story linked to this article, see our blog <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=86&amp;idC=101&amp;idRec=1126&amp;recType=story\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Missing Moscow&#39;s Drug Bonanza</a><a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=86&amp;idC=101&amp;idRec=1126&amp;recType=story\\\" style=\\\"\\\">.</a></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"fb2bf9d6-2d05-4338-8f00-40ecb49c9f98\"}]"}, "pk": 1123, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Since then the USL has gained power in Romania.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now this Governing bloc rejected its own proposal in a vote where 218 opposed the bill, with 72 in favor.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The lead-up to this ballot was monitored by the US State Department. Four days before the vote, the Foreign Agricultural Service of the US Embassy in Bucharest expressed its concern about the proposed ban in a report to the US Department of Agriculture.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;If approved, the new draft law would clearly place at risk biotech seed producers,&quot; it stated.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Almost every time Romanian leaders prepare to vote on a ruling regarding GMOs, the US Embassy in Bucharest and American politicians use the pressure of soft politics on local politicians to favor the biotech industry.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The Americans have wooed key actors in Romanian agriculture through financing programs that allowed Romanian politicians to travel to the US to study American agriculture. They also arranged for American biotech experts to meet with Romanian officials in Bucharest.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The most important player in this industry, US mega-corporation Monsanto, also wields influence in an effort to convince Romanian politicians to introduce large scale agricultural biotechnology in their home country and the EU.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The company has contributed to the political campaigns of dozens of American Congresspersons and Senators. Some of these politicians traveled to Romania to try to demonstrate to local officials the benefits of biotechnology. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;This illustrates the connection between Monsanto and the Romanian authorities - this is how the mechanism works,&quot; argues Ramona Duminicioiu, president of The Info Center about Genetically Modified Organisms in Cluj-Napoca, which opposes GMO cultivation in Romania.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The stakes are high. Monsanto has invested around 150 million USD in its Romanian seed production units and is planning to spend another 40 million USD on its facility in Sinesti, Ialomita county, over the next two years.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">GMO cash bets on Romania</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Since 2005, Bucharest has been visited by over nine key Congresspersons and Senators who received funds from big farming.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Between 2004 and 2012, these elected officials cashed in a total of 0.57 million USD in campaign donations from Monsanto and Political Action Committees (PAC) supporting the use of GMOs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2008, when the Romanian authorities were considering banning the only GMO allowed to grow on the nation&rsquo;s soil, Monsanto&rsquo;s maize MON180, US Senator Richard Lugar came to Bucharest to meet then-Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu and then-Minister of Environment, Attila Korodi.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The press release following the meeting says nothing about agriculture, but a State Department cable released by Wikileaks is more revealing:&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Highlighting his experience as a farmer, visiting Senator Richard Lugar on 28 August encouraged Minister of Environment Attila Korodi to permit the use of more advanced agricultural methods in Romania, including biotechnology,&rdquo; the cable says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Lugar, at that time a member of the US Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, had received 15,000 USD in campaign donations from Monsanto between 2000 and 2012, according to Opensecrets.org, a group that tracks the influence of money on US politics.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Starting from 2004 until 2012, he also received a total of 26,500 USD from CropLife America, Cargill, Inc. and Archers Daniels Midland, organizations and companies promoting GMOs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Lugar was also a firm supporter of the Global Harvest Initiative, a group promoting the interests of the biotech industry. Its membership includes biotech giants such as Monsanto and Pioneer.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Former Minister Korodi says that the meeting with Senator Lugar was &ldquo;surprising&rdquo;.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It seemed curious that there were so many diplomats - the US Ambassador with a whole team,&rdquo; he says now. &ldquo;They were very well prepared for this meeting. They were expecting from me a more flexible position [on permitting GMO cultivation], but I wasn&rsquo;t flexible.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">We tried to contact Lugar through his press office, but we did not get a response.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Big money equals big demands</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Monsanto is a huge contributor to American political campaigns. According to opensecrets.org, in 2012 Monsanto&rsquo;s PAC, Monsanto Co., contributed a total of 385,000 USD to the campaigns of 88 Congressmen and Senators.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">PACs interested in promoting GMOs contributed a total of 4.37 million USD in the same electoral cycle, according to MapLight.org, a research organization revealing money&rsquo;s influence on politics.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">There is nothing immoral about such contributions, argues Michael Phillips, a biotech adviser to governments, industry and NGOs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;That goes on in all political campaigns in the United States,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Companies usually donate to both the Republican Party and the Democrat Party. It&rsquo;s no different than the auto, manufacturing or telecommunication industries.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Agricultural companies spend large amounts of money lobbying for or against legislation and regulation in Washington. Among these, Monsanto invested the largest amount on lobbying federal institutions and agencies on behalf of agricultural services and products in 2012 - a total of 5.97 million USD, according to opensecrets.org.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Monsanto representatives in Romania say that the company participates in the US political process in a manner similar to many businesses, labor unions, trade groups or issue organizations, in part through a political action committee.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But Bill Lambrecht, journalist and author of a book challenging genetic engineering, &lsquo;Dinner at the New Gene Cafe&rsquo;, argues that the system favors immoral links between politicians and corporations.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Two years ago, the Supreme Court allowed practically unlimited corporate donations and what we call &lsquo;dark money&rsquo;, for which we don&rsquo;t even know the source,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If you give this money [to congresspersons] in campaigns, you&rsquo;ll receive something in return.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">During the same period, American authorities were using public money to help the biotech industry develop in Romania, which could bring benefits to Monsanto.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The US State Department finances scientific conferences attended by high-ranking local politicians. According to cables distributed through Wikileaks, these events were financed from Biotech Outreach funds, which aim to promote the acceptance of GMOs in some countries.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The funds were administered by the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs within the US State Department.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In late 2008, then Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice informed US embassies in 22 &ldquo;key countries&rdquo;, including Romania, that they could use this cash to invite specialists to speak about the benefits of biotechnology to local politicians and scientists.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Why does the US target Romania?</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Romania&rsquo;s history of GM cultivation in the 1990s and early 2000s means the country remains a soft touch for US corporations and the US State Department in its search for a GM-friendly lobbyist in Brussels.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Following the break up of the Communist bloc, Monsanto built on its presence in Romania to expand its sale of hybrids and GMO seeds.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Just before the ex-communist country joined the European Union in 2007, Romania had become one of the largest growers of GMO soybeans in Europe. In 2006, the number of hectares seeded with GMO soybeans was around 137,300, almost double compared to the year before and three-quarters of the nation&rsquo;s total soybean crop.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Based on its experience using biotechnology, Romania represents a functional model that could convince the EU authorities to change their attitude to GMOs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2005, Thomas Delare, then charge d&#39;affaires at the US Embassy in Bucharest, wrote in a cable to the Department of State, according to Wikileaks: &quot;By increasing efforts in Romania now, the US will have a strong European ally with common interests and shared beliefs to combat the EU&#39;s anti-GMO position in the years ahead.&quot;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In Washington, Romania&#39;s biotech past is also considered a success.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;Romania has, in some ways, more similarities to the United States than some other parts of Europe,&rdquo; says one US State Department official. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more accepting of new technologies and it&rsquo;s unique because it has real experience with the success of biotechnology. And it&rsquo;s something that few other European countries have. I think there&rsquo;s an opportunity for Romania to be a leader within Europe, to explain that there are indeed benefits to farmers [from GMOs].&quot;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Therefore the use of Romania as a &lsquo;fifth column&rsquo; of pro-GM lobbyists within an anti-GM EU seems to have been the strategic plan of the US in the last decade.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">GMOs: why the EU hate and the US love?</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The US is a strong promoter of GMO solutions for agriculture, while the EU is against this form of &ldquo;mutant&rdquo; crop invading its rolling hills and plains.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Part of the reason for this opposition is economic. The major producers of GMOs are American and if the EU opens its farmland to develop GMOs, this will be to the benefit of seed companies from outside its borders.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But another reason is the psychology of the two economic blocs. The EU takes a more cautionary approach to an untested form of agriculture which betrays its traditions, while the US prefers a pragmatic stance which is centered on next year&rsquo;s balance sheet. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;In the US, we adopt a risk-benefit analysis that is mainly economic,&rdquo; says Will Allen, a pro-organic farmer from Vermont, opposed to GM seeds. &ldquo;We say - &lsquo;Well, if it kills one person in a million, then it is tolerable, because the economic benefits are greater than the loss of a life&rsquo;. Europeans take a precaution because they&#39;re not sure whether it is dangerous.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"US goes for the money, EU plays safety first: Will Allen, pro-organic farmer\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/will_allen_pro-organic_VERMONT.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: initial; width: 945px;\\\" /></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The large percentage of American farmers who embrace biotechnology seems to be a strong argument for the US State Department&rsquo;s position.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;It&rsquo;s pretty clear that farmers love the technology,&rdquo; says one State Department official. &ldquo;The adoption rate in US, Brazil and China has shown that pretty much every time you have access to the technology, you end up with [up to] a 90 per cent adoption rate.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Currently EU legislation prohibits the growth of GMOs in its 27 member countries, with two exceptions approved by the Union&#39;s control institution, European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) - one type of corn and one type of potato.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But EU member states rely on massive GMO soybean imports for animal feed because they do not have the capacity to produce competitive non-GM crops. According to the European Commission, the member states imported 11.9 million tons of soybean and 21.2 million tons of soymeal in 2011 and 2012, the bulk of which is from GM sources. This has led the pro-GM lobby to accuse the EU of hypocrisy.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In July 2010, the European Commission proposed a new set of rules that would give Member States full responsibility for cultivation in their territories. For Monsanto, such a decision would be highly lucrative. The decision is pending, as member states have different views on biotechnology.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;After South America was conquered, Europe is one of the last &lsquo;resistance movements&rsquo; Monsanto has to defeat,&rdquo; says Brian Tokar, from the Institute for Social Ecology, a pro-environment organization based in Vermont.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Permanent Revolution: a century of Romanian Agriculture</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Romania should be an agricultural powerhouse. With a perfect mix of forest and pastoral lands in the north and centre and flat warm plains in the south, the country belongs to a rich and fertile belt of black earth running from Bulgaria through Moldova to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Agricultural land stretches over 13.3 million hectares, more than half of the country&rsquo;s surface. Romania has about six per cent of the total utilized agricultural area in EU and the seventh largest farmland in the union, after France, Spain, Germany, UK, Poland and Italy.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Between the two world wars, during the leadership of Romanian King Ferdinand I, a land reform bill divided the large estates into lands for nearly 1.4 million farmers, and exports of wheat and corn increased.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After the second world war, the new communist state confiscated the land in a 15-year nationalization process. The state gave Romanian peasants shares from the crops they gathered as employees of collective farms. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">As the Communist dictators Gheorghe Gheorghiu Dej and Nicolae Ceausescu introduced a programme of rapid industrialization with new factories that were hungry for workers, the Romanian population transformed from rural to urban.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"GM Dictator: Ceausescu had grand plans for biotech (Credit: Fototeca Online a Comunismului Romanesc)\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/fototeca_6_1971.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: initial; width: 945px;\\\" /></p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the 1960s, peasants represented around two thirds of all Romanians, but three decades later the urban population became predominant.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The communist authorities adopted a mechanization process and introduced large scale use of pesticides, which increased yields at the expense of ruining farming traditions.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">US agri-giant Monsanto started developing its business in Romania in 1975, where the company opened an agency for selling herbicides.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 1989, months before the change of regime, the Communist Party adopted a draft that contained a perspective over the next two decades of Romanian agriculture until 2010.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Biotechnology played an important role in the plans of Ceausescu.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The document called for a &ldquo;new agricultural revolution&rdquo; which included prioritizing research on creating varieties of plants and hybrids &ldquo;with superior genetic resistance to low temperature, drought and disease&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 1990, the state gave land back to the peasants, creating millions of small agricultural holdings. Two million of these holdings are under one hectare (two acres). But many of these plots are stricken with inefficient farming methods, while others lie dormant, leading many analysts to believe that Romania is a country ripe for huge agriculture exploitation.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The country&rsquo;s most important crops are wheat, corn, sunflower, oilseed rape and soybeans. After 2007, when Romania became an EU member, most exports focused on the European market.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2011, the country exported agricultural products with a total value of 57 billion USD, of which 41 billion USD were bought by EU countries.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Bill Frothingham and Sarah Capungan also contributed to this report.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This investigation is a version of longer report published by <a href=\\\"http://www.necir-bu.org\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The New England Center for Investigative Reporting (NECIR).</a></p>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"4a2d4033-8e65-44ca-8b00-d834d9a7493b\"}]"}, "pk": 1131, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

This model can help such owners launder money and avoid tax.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Neither Firtash nor Kalinovskaya responded to requests for comment for this article.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Issued on 8 June 2007, the order stated that the Ukrainian billionaire hid assets from his ex-wife and set up at least two businesses through CTL, a register agent in the BVI.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">BVI regulators - the Financial Services Commission - found that CTL violated the islands&rsquo; money laundering laws and banned it from taking on new clients, according to internal company documents, leaked to ICIJ.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A High Court judge in the BVI said Maria Kalinovskaya was seeking to preserve her presumptive 50 per cent interest in the &ldquo;very substantial assets&rdquo; of the marriage that were &ldquo;fraudulently concealed&rdquo; by Firtash through &ldquo;various entities&rdquo; in different locations.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The decision to allow Kalinovskaya&rsquo;s lawyers to go hunting for Firtash&rsquo;s assets was unprecedented for offshore jurisdictions.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Due to leaked emails, we can reveal how this order shocked BVI registration officials, who feared it could break down the entire system of off-shore payments to the tropical archipelago.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Tax paradise, global loss</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The vast flow of offshore money &mdash; legal and illegal, personal and corporate &mdash; can roil economies and pit nations against each other.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Europe&rsquo;s continuing financial crisis has been fueled by a Greek fiscal disaster exacerbated by offshore tax cheating and a banking meltdown in the tax haven of Cyprus, where local banks&rsquo; assets have been inflated by waves of cash from Russia.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Anti-corruption campaigners argue that offshore secrecy undermines law and order and forces the average person on the street to pay higher taxes to make up for revenues that vanish overseas. Studies have estimated that cross-border flows of global proceeds of financial crimes total between one trillion USD and 1.6 trillion USD a year.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.icij.org/offshore/about-project-secrecy-sale\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ICIJ&rsquo;s 15-month investigation</a> found that, alongside perfectly legal transactions, the secrecy and lax oversight offered by the offshore world allows fraud, tax dodging and political corruption to thrive.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ukraine is a major victim of capital flight and is a relatively huge recipient of money from offshore jurisdictions.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">According to a 2012 report by US-based think tank Tax Justice Network, Ukraine ranked 15th worldwide on a list of capital flight source countries.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The report added that Ukraine has contributed some 166.8 billion USD to the global offshore industry. As the top foreign investor into Ukraine, offshore Cyprus has put 17.6 billion USD - almost one third of all FDI inflows - into the country. Furthermore, such offshore jurisdictions as the British Virgin Islands and Belize have invested heavily into Ukraine &ndash; with 2.2 billion USD and one billion USD, respectively.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Much of this is suspected to be repatriated money.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">By comparison, US investment in Ukraine since independence in 1991 has been 880 million USD.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This use of offshore havens by Ukrainian businessmen has massively distorted the nation&rsquo;s economy which, despite its size and assets, has a GDP per capita below Bosnia-Herzegovina, Namibia and Algeria.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;Beginning of the end&quot; for BVI</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">According to leaked emails from 2007, Scott Wilson, the co-owner of CTL, was terrified when Maria&nbsp;Kalinovskaya obtained the order to force his company to disclose information.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">His correspondences refer to fears of a &lsquo;fishing expedition&rsquo;, which in legalese means giving the lawyers access to find information outside of the scope of the initial case.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Wilson stated: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even sure what [the order] means (and if it means all records, I&rsquo;m not even sure how we could comply), so if it means what it seems to mean, this is unprecedented. This would be a fishing expedition of the most extreme definition. Not only would compliance with such an order be the end of us, it would be the beginning of the end for BVI.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Wilson concluded his e-mail message: &ldquo;Frankly, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect something like this to fly even in New York and I am astonished that the judge is not tossing these guys out of his BVI courtroom.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Thomas Ward, his partner, thought that &ldquo;this is an amazing order.

CTL sought to use the courts to delay and frustrate the order.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">One scare tactic used by CTL against Kalinovskaya and her lawyers was to claim a huge legal bill of more than 200,000 USD. At the beginning of the court trial, a CTL lawyer asked the judge to order Firtash&rsquo;s ex-wife to immediately pay 58,675 USD to cover the offshore register&rsquo;s legal costs so far and put up security for another 175,000 USD to cover its legal and paperwork costs going forward.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Email communications show the real legal costs were about 5,000 USD and Firtash&rsquo;s personal lawyer Colin Mason even filed a complaint in the local court against the inflated costs asked by CTL.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The order to access the information was eventually quashed on 18 July 2007, but not before Mason got involved, flying to the British Virgin Islands to take part in the court hearings.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The domain part of Mason&rsquo;s e-mail address &ndash; Scythian.co.uk &ndash; is the company, Scythian, that <a href=\\\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/25/partyfunding-conservatives\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">was paying tens of thousands of dollars in donations</a> to British Conservative Party MP Pauline Neville-Jones through Robert Shetler-Jones of one of Firtash&rsquo;s companies Group DF, according to newspaper The Guardian.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Partners in Business and Pleasure</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Kalinovskaya and Firtash were married between 2002 and 2005. In interviews and according to a 2007 investigation conducted by the newspaper Ukrainska Pravda, she helped Firtash start his business. They worked together in the early 1990s in Ukraine, Russia and Germany.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She initially got a divorce settlement of 36 million USD, but felt cheated after learning her ex-husband was worth more. In 2006, the Ukrainian news magazine Korrespondent estimated Firtash&rsquo;s assets at 1.4 billion USD.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">That same year Firtash set up Group DF (after his initials), months after he publicly admitted owning a big stake in RosUkrEnergo, a monopoly gas supplier to Ukraine partnered with Russian gas giant Gazprom.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Group DF Limited became the holding company for Firtash&rsquo;s vast interests in energy, chemicals and real estate.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Firtash has expanded his chemicals empire in Ukraine since President Viktor Yanukovych took office in February 2010.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In recent years he ventured into philanthropic projects, notably funding the Cambridge Ukrainian Studies department in England and revamping the campus of the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Today Firtash, 48, is worth an estimated 3.2 billion USD, according to Korrespondent&rsquo;s latest assessment conducted with Kyiv-based investment bank Dragon Capital.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Maze of offshores</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Over the last decade Firtash has extensively used Common Law offshore jurisdictions to register his wide network of companies.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">His maze of offshore holdings was so complex, it seems the billionaire himself was at times confused about their status.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In early 2009, one of his associates sold his Hungarian firm EMFESZ, a serious gas player, for one dollar to an unknown company from Switzerland, RosGas.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This deal was administered by Istvan Goczi, a director at the CTL-registered Group DF, who sold EMFESZ&rsquo;s Cyprus-based parent company Mabofi.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Firtash did not seem happy about this deal.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He terminated his working arrangement with Goczi, but had to go to court to <a href=\\\"http://www.kyivpost.com/content/business/court-upholds-firtash-ownership-of-hungarian-gas-t.html\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">regain control over EMFESZ in February 2013</a>.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Documents leaked to ICIJ also show that CTL was sitting on a treasure trove of information related to Firtash and entities related to Kyiv-born crime lord Semion Mogilevich, who earlier topped the US Federal Bureau of Investigation&rsquo;s most wanted list. Some of the entities owned luxury properties, such as the Three Musketeers Castle in France.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The data revealed that CTL had earlier handled company registrations for Group DF and DF Investments, both belonging to Firtash, through Cypriot law firm Demetriades Shakos Pifanis.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The person handling all incorporations was a senior partner at the law firm, <a href=\\\"http://www.crowehorwath.net/CY/about/History.aspx\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Andreas Pifanis</a>.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Pifanis didn&rsquo;t respond to a request to provide comment for this article.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Altogether ICIJ found that Pifanis had registered some 140 companies with CTL starting in 2005 and ending in 2009, in most of the cases using Annex Holdings as a director. Some of these companies were or are officially part of Firtash&rsquo;s group and some are unknown to the public.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Annex Holdings made headlines in 2005 when it paid a Washington D.C. lobbying firm to represent the interests of then-Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Boyko, a close associate of Firtash.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">According to US diplomatic cables, Boyko had helped set up Swiss-registered RosUkrEnergo and sat on one of its boards. He also wielded power-of-attorney control over Firtash&rsquo;s assets in the past.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">An ICIJ investigation based on leaked documents also found that among the companies registered by CTL, two are linked to Mogilevich: Highrock Properties established in 2000, but which was later re-named Kemnasta Investments Ltd under lawyer Pifanis&rsquo; supervision, and Barlow Investing Ltd, registered on behalf of Galina Telesh, former wife of Mogilevich.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Highrock Holding, a similarly named vehicle, was used both by Firtash and Mogilevich&rsquo;s associates or their former wives, according to the Financial Times.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">US State Department cables posted on WikiLeaks website have reported that Firtash acknowledged to a top American diplomat &ldquo;that he needed, and received, permission from Mogilevich when he established various businesses, but he denied any close relationship to him.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Internal CTL company documents also showed that it had set up Lacoste de Pratviel Ltd in 2006, a winery that is part of a famous castle &ndash; Chateau d&rsquo;Arricau-Bordes &ndash; worth more than three million Euro. The castle was listed as the property of Shetler-Jones in 2010, a supervisory board member at Group DF and its CEO from 2007 to August 2012.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In a letter to the owner of CTL, Pifanis describes the nature of his business: &ldquo;As I explained to you during our meeting we are involved in serious money transactions through the use of BVI companies.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In a later email he explains that Firtash is one of his biggest clients: &ldquo;this Group is one of the largest Groups we administer, who have already bought from us few dozens of BVI companies that we bought from you.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Pifanis furthermore appears keen to please Firtash and becomes agitated when things drag at CTL.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">One of CTL employee&rsquo;s, Shonia Matthew, alleged to a colleague in a 7 December 2006 email that she was threatened by Pifanis: &ldquo;he once threatened he will kill me if he comes to BVI and since then I am handling his requests professionally and without delay&hellip; but at the same time no extra &lsquo;sweetness&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Multinational money-laundering exposed</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Documents used to report on this story come from a cache of 2.5 million files, which cracked open the secrets of more than 120,000 offshore companies and trusts, exposing hidden dealings of politicians, con men and the mega-rich the world over.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The <a href=\\\"http://offshoreleaks.icij.org/\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">secret records</a> obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists lay bare the names behind covert companies and private trusts in the British Virgin Islands, the Cook Islands and other offshore hideaways.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">These secret files show CTL had served as a middleman for an extensive list of shady operators around the world, including in Russia and the US &ndash; setting up offshore companies for securities swindlers, Ponzi fraudsters and individuals linked to political corruption, arms trafficking and organized crime.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">There&rsquo;s no evidence CTL engaged in fraud or other crimes. Records obtained by ICIJ indicate, however, that CTL often failed to check&nbsp;who its real clients were and what they were up to &ndash; a process that anti-money-laundering experts say&nbsp;is vital to preventing fraud and other illicit activities in the offshore world.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The documents show authorities in the British Virgin Islands failed for years to take aggressive action against CTL, even after they concluded the firm was violating the islands&rsquo; anti-money laundering laws.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">CTL co-founder Thomas Ward blames many of the firm&rsquo;s problems on &ldquo;the law of large numbers.&rdquo; Anytime you form thousands of companies for thousands of people, he said, a few of them may be up to no good.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In a written response to questions from ICIJ, Ward said CTL chose its clients carefully and that it had no more problems than other offshore services firms of similar size.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I regard myself as an ethical person. I don&rsquo;t think I intentionally did anything wrong,&rdquo; said Ward, who has worked as a consultant for the firm since selling it to new owners in 2009, in a telephone interview. &ldquo;I certainly didn&rsquo;t aid and abet anybody doing anything illegal.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It was not until February 2008 &ndash; nearly five years after regulators first found CTL in violation of anti-money-laundering rules &ndash; that BVI&rsquo;s Financial Services Commission took action that threatened to put the company out of business.

Early Spring 2011. A forest in a small valley outside Tiraspol, capital of Moldova&rsquo;s unrecognized Republic of Transnistria.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Along a dirt path, an interrogator and three guards are marshalling Moldovan businessman, Vitalie Eriomenco, who is suffering from multiple head wounds due to hours of torture.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They stop in a clearing between the trees, where the interrogator throws a shovel at the 43 year-old prisoner&rsquo;s feet and tells him to start digging.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;You will die in the next few minutes,&rdquo; he tells Vitalie. &ldquo;If you want to be buried in this forest, you should start digging now.

Guards kick detainees and use blunt objects or rubber bats to give blows to the kidneys. Convicts also face solitary confinement without food or water.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">If these physical forms of torture fail to yield results for the authorities, they resort to creative methods of abuse, such as threatening the victims with arresting their relatives.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Family strike</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Vitalie&rsquo;s ordeal&nbsp;started on the morning of 29 March 2011, when six men in plain clothes, members of Transnistria&rsquo;s Department for Combating Organized Crime and Corruption (DCOCC), came to his office and arrested him without a warrant.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">At 10:00 PM, eight men - plain-clothes police officers - dragged the handcuffed Vitalie to his house to perform a search, shocking his wife and two sons.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Without a warrant, the police scoured the home&nbsp;for evidence for two hours.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">At midnight, they forced Vitalie&rsquo;s wife and two sons to leave the house, without any change of clothes or personal effects. They sheltered with friends, and later Vitalie&rsquo;s wife and baby son moved to Chisinau.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The authorities prevented Vitalie from meeting a lawyer. After two days of detention, his interrogator forced him to sign a document renouncing his legal counsel and stating that he would represent himself before court.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">On the third day, the authorities provided him with a lawyer of their choosing, while his family hired another from Moldova.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">However, the family and lawyers had no access to the details of the case.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Vitalie was a prosperous businessman. From a small town - Vadu lui Voda - on the other side of the River Nistru&nbsp;which borders the two territories of Moldova, he moved to Transnistria in 2002 to set up his first enterprise.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">In 2011, by the day of his arrest, there were more than 400 people working for his four companies in the town of Slobozia. This included bread and beer production factories, a mineral water bottle filling factory and a mill.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">After the arrest, the authorities told him that his business partner&nbsp;Victor Petriman&nbsp;complained to the DCOCC, accusing Eriomenco of stealing from the companies&rsquo; accounts.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;As far as I know, [his associate and the DCOCC] didn&rsquo;t mean this to go so far,&rdquo; Gherman says. &ldquo;All they wanted was to scare him and to make him give up his majority share [in the business]. But after I went to Tiraspol and met the interrogator, he told me the price of my brother&rsquo;s freedom would be one million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Ala and her brother&rsquo;s fortune - even if they sold everything - could not cover such a high amount.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The interrogator said my brother could easily find himself dead,&rdquo; says Ala. &ldquo;It happens quite often there.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">According to ex-detainees from Transnistrian&rsquo;s penitentiaries, there are cases of prisoners who die by hanging, many of whom are unlikely to be suicides.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Ala understood that she was also at risk.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The interrogator called her after their discussion, telling Ala that his &ldquo;men&rdquo; could come to Moldova, drag her into a van and bring her to Transnistria.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;You think that if you&rsquo;re in Moldova, you&rsquo;re safe?&rdquo; he said to her.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">For the last two years, Ala has been campaigning to free Vitalie, while he stays detained in prison, without a trial to convict him.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">His health is deteriorating and he has not seen his four year-old son&nbsp;for two years - missing out on spending time with him&nbsp;as he learns to talk, count and form relationships.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"gallery\\\"><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">|<img alt=\\\"UN criticism: Transnistrian prisons witness failing health and poor care of detainees\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Prison%201.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 873px; \\\"><img alt=\\\"Overgrown, rusty, leaky and infected: prison colony desperate for revamp\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Prison%201%20(3).jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 873px; \\\"></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Cocked and prepared: Prison watch poised to act\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Prison%201%20(2)(1).jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 873px; \\\"><img alt=\\\"Time out: prison guards enjoy the famed Transnistrian ice cream\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/DSC_0150.JPG\\\" style=\\\"width: 873px; \\\"></p></div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">UN: Forced confessions common</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The UN&rsquo;s first official Report on Human Rights in Transnistria, published in 2013, describes extreme measures in the prison system to force confessions out of detainees.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">UN expert Thomas Hammarberg visited Transnistria three times in 2012. He met with politicians, heads of the judiciary, prosecution and law enforcement, and with detainees and representatives of civil society.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The report shows that besides torture, the prison system has&nbsp;alarming problems such as overcrowding, prisoners with failing health and poor care.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">In October 2012, there were 2,858 detainees in three penitentiary colonies for men and one for women in Transnistria. From these, 2,224 were convicted and 634 held in detention, like Vitalie.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">This clocks up at approximately 500 prisoners for 100,000 persons - over three times the European average of 154.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS are major problems in the colonies - with 54 infections of TB in two of the major prisons and tens of cases of HIV.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Ilie Cazac, a former tax inspector, accused by Transnistrian authorities of espionage, stayed in Prison Nr 1 in Tiraspol, where up to seven stayed in a cell for four people.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;People were dying all the time,&rdquo; says Cazac. Removed to Prison nr. 2, he says there were two deaths every month, due to TB, AIDS-related infections, Hepatitis C and suicide by hanging.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Cazac argues that patients received no appropriate medical care, while medicine was rarely available. If any convict had a pain in the tooth, heart or head, the prison doctors would not supply them with drugs.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Organizations such as the Red Cross, Medical Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims &ndash; &ldquo;Memoria&rdquo; and the U.S and Czech Embassies have sent medicine to the prisoners. But these packages rarely reached the inmates.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Ernest Vardanean, a journalist and former detainee, claims that a pharmacy chain in Transnistria is owned by the head of the Healthcare Center of Ministry of Justice, which controls the prisons.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Vardanean alleges&nbsp;that this individual told him he would take the pills granted from international donors, for himself, using words along the lines of - &ldquo;Guys, you must understand, I am a businessman, the pills must be sold.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">However, due to reporting restrictions in Transnistria, we could not verify this information.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Vitalie has a stomach ulcer, prostatitis and neurological and heart problems - but, according to his sister, the authorities denied him access to a doctor.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Since his detention, his health worsened due to the lack of adequate medical care and poor conditions.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">However, the results of the medical examinations he undergoes in prison always show that his health is perfect.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;He spent six months in a cell with 24 beds, while there were 36 convicts,&rdquo; says Ala Gherman, Vitalie&rsquo;s sister. &ldquo;They were taking turns to sleep in bed.

This is because the case is of a financial nature and is complex for the authorities.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Eriomenco&rsquo;s enterprises are registered both in Chisinau and Tiraspol,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Here, he appears in the documents as the director, while in Transnistria he was forced to give up his shares. The case is manufactured; they have no proof&nbsp;nor&nbsp;witnesses.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">This is part of a trend which Zubco identifies as the &lsquo;Soviet Raid&rsquo;. An entrepreneur is making money. His rivals and/or associates are jealous. So they use their connections in Government, judicial circles and law enforcement to create a superficially legal justification to sequester their assets.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Eriomenco could seek justice&nbsp;in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). His case is under debate as it may violate Article Five of the International Convention of the Human Rights, granting everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. Eriomenco&rsquo;s case is at an advanced level.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">However around 60 former and actual detainees in the Transnistrian prison system are waiting for a decision from ECHR. If this rules in Eriomenco&rsquo;s favour, the Court informs the two involved states - the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation (which de facto controls Transnistria), requesting them to pay compensation to the injured party.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Until now, ECHR has given three decisions regarding human rights&nbsp;in the region and the court has notified Moldova and Russia of 13 further cases of illegal arrest and detention. If ECHR gives decisions in favour of these 13 complainants, Moldova or Russia will be forced to pay compensation amounting to one million euro.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Before sending a file to ECHR, lawyers must gain evidence that the state they are suing has made concrete actions towards helping its citizens.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Moldova has the main responsibility because the territory belongs to her,&rdquo; says Zubco. &ldquo;However, every time we send a petition or a request [to any Moldovian authorities], they say &lsquo;sorry, guys, we can&rsquo;t help you, come back when the conflict is over&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">This &lsquo;mini-cold war&rsquo; has now lasted 22 years.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">When the lawyers mention the word Transnistria, the Moldovan authorities shrug their shoulders.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a football game,&rdquo; says Zubco, &ldquo;they pass the ball one to another.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Moldova&rsquo;s Office for Reintegration aims to promote the government&rsquo;s reintegration policy of the two territories, including&nbsp;the negotiation process for conflict settlement.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">But its chief, George Balan, explains that Moldova has limited powers.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Because of the totalitarian and authoritarian regime [in Transnistria], any kind of information is blocked,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know how many Moldovans or foreign citizens are in Transnistrian prisons. The figures in the UN report are the only ones we have.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Eriomenco&rsquo;s sister says that her attempts to find justice through the Moldovan authorities were unsuccessful.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">When her brother was arrested, she brought the case to the attention of the General Prosecution in Chisinau. The office gave her an answer, which she paraphrases as -&nbsp;&ldquo;If he was stupid enough to start a business there, then what can we do now?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Balan says that he has not visited any penitentiaries.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have real instruments to help,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;When we receive information about concrete cases, we make approaches to international organizations and raise awareness. We try to make it easier for the detainees by sending packages with food and presents on Christmas or Easter holidays.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Chisinau: backdoor deals with Tiraspol</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Although all information between the two states is &lsquo;blocked&rsquo;, there is proof of cooperation between the security authorities in Chisinau and Tiraspol regarding the supply of private information about its citizens, including children.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">When Eriomenco&rsquo;s family obtained access to Vitalie&rsquo;s case, they discovered something that shocked them.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">A letter sent on 22 December 2011 by Andrei Mejinschi, the head of Transnistria&rsquo;s DCOCC to Gheorghe Tretiacov, the chief of Criminal Police in Chisinau, asked for information about Eriomenco&rsquo;s parents, children and brothers.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The letter stated: &ldquo;For investigation, we request information regarding residence visa, criminal records, goods and assets: houses, apartment, lands, enterprises, etc.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">It appears from the file that Moldova gave private information about its citizens to the breakaway Republic - which its authorities claim is a black hole full of Soviet-style apparatchiks with whom it is impossible to deal.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Ala Gherman sued the National Centre for Personal Data Protection and, as a result, the chief of Criminal Police sent her an official notice stating that they had broken the law.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Balan explains that the information trade was made on older agreements from 1999 and 2001 between the two Ministers of Internal Affairs in the field of criminal corruption. Both Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Moldova and Minister of Internal Affairs invalidated the agreement in 2005.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;However, the two Governments continued to exchange information after that,&rdquo; argues Zubco.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">On 23 April, the Center District Court from Chisinau issued a decision according to which Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) must pay, as compensation, 32,000 Moldovan lei each to Vitalie Eriomenco and the members of his family. This is pending appeal.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">According to Gherman, any kind of recompense is &ldquo;too late&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The Transnistrians now know absolutely everything about us,&rdquo; she says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Since the sister of Vitalie complained to the media about his incarceration and torture, the Transnistrian authorities have prevented her from passing onto their territory.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Vitalie&rsquo;s parents also never visit him in the prison. The only time when they can see him is during his hearings, where he sits in a white cell in a court room, waiting for a judge to decide whether to acquit him or send his case to trial.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Waiting for justice: The parents of  Vitalie Eriomenco\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/DSC_0181.JPG\\\" style=\\\"width: 873px; \\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Court - the only chance to see a son</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">I meet with Eriomenco&rsquo;s parents and the Moldovan lawyer in June, as they prepare to visit a Tiraspol court for their son&rsquo;s 38th hearing in 27 months.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">In the courtroom there is a prosecutor, a lady who is silent during the whole meeting and the representative of the alleged victim, Victor Petriman, Eriomenco&rsquo;s Moldovan and Transnistrian lawyers, a policeman in plain clothes and another in uniform, carrying a Kalashnikov.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The judge, Tverkovici Alexandr Borisovici, walks into the courtroom - wearing sunglasses.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Vitalie is in a blue shirt and looks pale. He sits on a bench, leaning towards the white bars of his cell, with his hands cupped on his ears.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">His hearing has been damaged since his time in prison, probably due to blows to the head by interrogators.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Often he asks the judge to repeat the questions.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Every time he makes this request, the judge shouts at him: &ldquo;I will not repeat the question again! Are you deaf?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The witnesses do not appear. The judge and prosecutor take documents from Eriomenco&rsquo;s lawyers. The proceeding lasts no more than 20 minutes.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;This is what they have been doing for two years,&rdquo; says Eriomenco&rsquo;s mother, Vera.&nbsp;&ldquo;They play with us. We always come prepared, with documents and papers, but they don&rsquo;t consider these. The witnesses never show up, so each hearing is a waste of time and money.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">After the court appearance, we go to the Prison Nr. 3 to leave a food package for Vitalie. It is a balmy warm summer day. A group of women in uniform are chatting and eating ice-cream.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Outside the main prison door are packages of various goods - a broom, raffia bags, bottles of mineral water and soda, toilet paper, tomatoes and sunflower seeds. Meanwhile the friends and relatives of the detainees are sitting on benches or in their cars, to shade from the heat.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">However clouds are beginning to pass across the sky.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Lida, a woman in a uniform, with short red hair, opens the small gates. The relatives rise from their seats, pick up their packages and rush to be first to get inside. I help Vera. We walk on a tiny path along a wire fence. Inside the building, we enter a room with dirty walls and a small window.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Usually, we must wait until someone calls our name through that window, but Vera is known by the prison staff. She often donates linen, radios, water and food to the prison. Every detainee has the right to a 30 kg package of food per month, but if the family wants to give him more, they must register this to the prison authorities as a donation for all the inmates.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">We exit the prison gates and return to the car, where the driver and Eriomenco&rsquo;s father, Tudor, are waiting to take us back to Chisinau.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The clouds above are now grey.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;So this is how our old age looks like,&rdquo; says Vera. &ldquo;Instead of growing up with our nephews and having a peaceful life, we buy food for our 43 year-old son, who is in prison.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">She is interrupted by Tudor, who looks through the car window, adding:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It looks like it&rsquo;s going to rain.&rdquo;</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"d6c5afc2-5c45-4314-9927-511caf110f4e\"}]"}, "pk": 1137, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

This they can live with.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But for the last three years another of their vital resources has been at risk - their water supply is vanishing.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Located in the Ararat Valley, Sayat Nova is on a low lying stretch of land endowed with favorable conditions for growing crops. The weather is dry and hot with May to October&nbsp;temperatures averaging 24 to 26 Celsius, while in July and August it can reach 42 degrees.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">These are perfect conditions for apricots, grapes, peaches, watermelon, tomatoes and eggplant - if there is a liquid resource.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">76 year-old Hrach&nbsp;Matevosyan lives in the center of the village where artesian well water used to freely flow.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For many years his family not only used the water for drinking, but also irrigated a small garden plot. Today his well has dried up and his garden risks ruination.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Across the village, other residents show us the courtyards, where their wells are covered in weeds.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They estimate that only a quarter of the wells in the city remain.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Although this water is for their farms, there is no other potable water near their homes, so they must drink straight from the underground aquifers.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For four years this water supply has been drying up.&nbsp;Throughout the valley, other villages experience a similar trend.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This is a tragedy that is affecting the village&rsquo;s demographic and its future survival.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Agriculture is among the only sources of jobs in the region and, without any other forms of income, many young people emigrate to work in Russia.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Garnik Hayrapetyan, a 62 year-old village resident of Sayat Nova, says:&nbsp;&ldquo;Look around and you&rsquo;ll see the old ones are the only ones left - the young people are leaving.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Exploitation from the top</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">During the same time the Ararat Valley has seen a boom in modern fish farming operations.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">These businesses&nbsp;use vast quantities of underground water to help raise thousands of tons of sturgeon, trout and whitefish.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Five years ago local entrepreneurs saw fish-farming as a high-margin business. Many of these&nbsp;owners are connected to the Parliament in Yerevan or even members of the elected chamber&nbsp;themselves.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Five farms, not all of which are connected to the authorities, are now operating in Sayat Nova.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The fear among the people is that these businesses are sucking the life out of the sustainable countryside to secure a quick return.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Even Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan is worried.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The agricultural sector of the Ararat Valley is at risk,&rdquo; he said in 2012. &ldquo;The water reserves we now have are quickly being exhausted.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">With free-flowing wells now drying up, villagers must pump water from a deeper source, causing the electricity bills to rocket and cutting into any profits they may hope to make from the sale of vegetables.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Fish farming operations drill holes very deep - at around 200 meters with thick pipes to suck the water out.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile the villagers spike at around 100 meters, a lower level, which means large quantities flow to the fish farms, while little is left to reach the village wells.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;In a few years it&rsquo;s possible the village will be completely without water,&rdquo; says Razmik Alaverdyan, the mayor of Sayat Nova. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Warning unheeded</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Three years ago leading experts warned the Government about the potential desertification of Armenia&rsquo;s rural heartland by 2020.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Back then Hovik Aghinyan, Chief Hydro-Geologist in the Ministry of the Environment, told local investigative publication Hetq that artesian waters of the Ararat Valley were used at unsustainable rates.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;If the current rates of usage continue, wells may no longer flow in ten years,&rdquo; he said at the time. &ldquo;Our future generations are at risk since it is the only long-term quality water reserve that can be used to supply potable water.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Vladimir Movsisyan, who heads a Presidential commission to help preserve Armenia&rsquo;s largest freshwater lake, Sevan, says that while the renewable artesian water reserves of the Ararat Valley are 1.3 billion cubic meters, the Ministry of the Environment has allowed 1.5 billion cubic meters to be tapped.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This over-exploitation, according to the expert, has lead to over one sixth of the Ararat Valley&rsquo;s 638 artesian wells running dry.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Movsisyan calls the Ministry of the Environment &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; for allowing this to happen.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The result is that 6,200 hectares of irrigable land is without water.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Therefore desperate farmers have turned to draining Lake Sevan, the legendary &lsquo;Sea of Armenia&rsquo; famed worldwide for its tasty but endangered Sevan Trout.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Last year, farms and businesses tapped 313 million cubic meters from Sevan&rsquo;s total water volume of 35 billion cubic meters - almost double the figure permitted by law.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Soaking up the resources, playing with the laws: Armenian fish farms\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Masis%20Fish%203(1).JPG\\\" style=\\\"height: initial; width: 960px;\\\" />Dodging the rules</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Fish-farms have been draining water from the ground at an illegal rate, experts fear.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Since 2010, farms can only use a quota of water from underground sources. So the Ministry of Environment can check up on this figure, each farming operation must install a water meter.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However our investigation reveals that as operators grow and their farms expand, those installing the meters have found tricks to show a lower amount of water usage, while some have not even installed the meters.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile small and local fish farms are closing down. Huge commercial operations are taking their place, often backed by top government officials, members of parliament and oligarchs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Sayat Nova-based company Masis Fish, which raises a sturgeon-type fish, is a huge water consumer. One of the owners of Masis Fish is Samvel Haroutyunyan, the former Cadastre Chief of the town of Masis.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He owns 70 per cent&nbsp;of the firm&#39;s stocks, while another 30 per cent&nbsp;belongs to Vagharshak Sargsyan, the son of Qadjik Sargsyan, head of the Ararat Territorial Department of&nbsp;Forest Control Division of the State Environmental Inspectorate.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At Masis Fish, water meters are installed on the pipes.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But photographs (left) we took at the location farm show a water meter is not installed on the large main flow pipe, only on a smaller auxiliary pipe. This indicates that large quantities of water flow through the unmonitored channel.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Illegal digging</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Yerevan offers permits to allow fish farms to bore holes into the ground to tap into the depleting water resources.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But it appears farms - including those connected to the Parliament itself - are flouting this rule and boring without approval.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In October 2010, when we visited the fish farm owned by Armenian MP Samvel Aleksanyan, the manager Movses Arakelyan told us that the operation tapped water from six or seven bore holes.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Afterwards, the Ministry of the Environment published a list of fish farming operations on its website, showing that Arakelyan had a permit for just one well.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the past three years, Aleksanyan&rsquo;s fish farming operation has expanded. Fish ponds now occupy two hectares of the operation&rsquo;s total 7.5 hectare expanse. Ten deep self-flowing wells, producing 960 liters of water per second, are now operating. The manager Movses Arakelyan confesses that water levels are dropping due to over-use.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">MP Aleksanyan also owns the Yerevan City chain of supermarkets, which sell the fish he raises.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However Arakelyan says that the fish trade has tumbled this year, and points to labor force migration as the cause. So far this year the number of work emigrants from Armenia has risen by 32 per cent on 2012&rsquo;s figures.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The customer base is eroding. Although the Yerevan City chain continues to grow, fish sales have dropped by up to 40 per cent.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Due to an oversupply, the retail price of fish has also fallen. Three years ago the price for a kilo of fish ranged from 1,700 to 2,000 AMD (around four to five USD). Now the price is around 1,500 AMD (3.5 USD).</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;There are no other commodities in Armenia as inexpensive as fish,&rdquo; says Arakelyan.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Farms drink themselves dry</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">During the Soviet period, Armenian fish farms raised 8,000 tons of carp and whitefish (sik), and 4,000 tons of lake trout (ishkhan) every year for consumers in the USSR, especially from Russia.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At that time, the farms used water from Lake Sevan and local rivers. Following Armenian independence in 1991, fish farms tapped into underground reserves of freshwater because ishkhan thrive in such conditions. Today, Armenia mostly produces ishkhan, sturgeon and carp.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">280 of the 319 fish farms operating in Armenia today are located in the Ararat Valley - 99 per cent of these are located on artesian wells.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">While experts have raised the alarm regarding the scarcity of water, fish farming operations continue to expand. The amount of fish which Armenia exports is growing, with Russia the number one customer, buying up one sixth of the product.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2011, Armenia produced 6,814 tons of fish and Russia imported 1,200 tons. In 2012, 8,000 tons were produced and 1,800 tons went to Russia.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However this enthusiasm for new farms risks over-using the water supplies not only for villages, but for the industry itself.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Fish farm manager Movses Arakelyan believes if the farms dig new deep wells, the water levels in other farms will drop. Fish farming risks drinking itself dry.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Armenian Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan has warned this over-exploitation could force a state of emergency.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We face a very huge water cost problem and it can create a tragic situation in the Ararat Valley,&rdquo; he said in July. &ldquo;There are hundreds of fish farms there that will also face a huge problem tomorrow. The water resources necessary for these enterprises to develop will no longer exist.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He stated that if the Government wishes to maintain a normal supply of irrigable water, it will need to tap an additional 150 million cubic meters of water from Lake Sevan, which is already suffering from mass-depletion.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The only way to expand the sector is to implement the European model of water recirculation, which means recycling the water resources. This could reduce the number of wells by 60 per cent.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The fish farms, popping up like mushrooms in the Ararat Valley must change over to a [recycling] system,&rdquo; says Vladimir Movsisyan, head of the Lake Sevan commission. &ldquo;The amounts of underground water used will drop by a factor of two to three.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But this is too expensive for farm investors to implement at a time when a glut in production means fish prices are plummeting.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The industry may be reaching the downward curve of a classic boom and bust scenario.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Two-thirds break law</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2011, when PM Sargsyan participated in the installation of water meters in Sipanik, he stated that this move was necessary to regulate the sector - given that scores of communities had been deprived of potable and irrigation water.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2011, Sargsyan argued that 2,000 of the 3,000 wells were illegal and that the Government was not properly calculating water consumption rates.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Since this revelation that over two thirds of wells are outside of the law, we wanted to find out what the state has done to combat this crime in fish farms.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Responding to our inquiry as to whether fish farming operations are monitored and inspected, the Armenian Ministry of the Environment told us forty fish farms were inspected in 2011.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They discovered several violations, regarding water usage permits, proper water usage and the preservation of water resources.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">As punishment, the Ministry gave out a total amount of fines worth 5,550 USD - about one-and-a-half times the annual salary for an average Armenian.

Even if that child is 40 years old, no one abandons him.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the Soviet Union, users only had access to giant glass and iron syringes, which they sterilized and used multiple times. Taking drugs was a group event - similar to a dinner party - where guests would meet together in an apartment, bringing along utensils and ingredients necessary for cooking drugs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;No one was injecting alone,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Injecting was socializing.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Most of these users were graduates from wealthy families or individuals well-positioned in the power structures of a centralised economy. This was part of a recreational trend of sedative abuse common among the educated classes of Poland and the USSR in the 1980s.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It was cool,&rdquo; Eka says of the opiates. &ldquo;No one will tell you it was bad. You are in a better world. You see different colors. You feel at your best. You can do anything you want. You have a kind of power. There is no kind of hesitation. You don&rsquo;t have any complexes.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Soon she left her job and became a full-time user. She had some awareness of the risks and, over the years, tried ten times to take treatment to release herself from the habit.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Afterwards I felt depressed and I felt bad,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I did not want to do anything at all and that&rsquo;s why I went back to injecting.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Heroin boom</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Following Georgia&#39;s independence from the USSR in 1991, heroin swarmed onto the streets of its cities. Traffickers smuggled the drug to Georgia via Azerbaijan and Chechnya.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">As the number of drug addicts rose, the police began to persecute them and use them for extortion.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It was possible to pay money to the police so they would not put me in prison or fine me,&rdquo; she says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The police were divided into districts in Tbilisi. Once one district&rsquo;s police learned that I was a drug user, they shared this information with the others. Then police from each of the districts would come up to me and demand me to work with them as an informer. But an informer was considered by users to be the lowest level of a person. So I paid a lot of money to the police. So much money that I would be rich today with that cash.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the mid-1990s, at seven am one morning, the police knocked on the door of her house.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;They told my mother they needed to talk to Eka,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was taken to the station. The head of the department was sitting behind a table - with four other cops around him. In his hands he was playing with two bags of heroin - one of five milligrams and another of one milligram. He asked me about one person I was acquainted with - who was a user. I said I didn&rsquo;t know him. Then he showed me a photograph the police had taken of the two of us together.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make us angry,&rsquo; he said. He ordered me to take the five mg bag of heroin to this guy, inject him and then leave the place and send a message to the cops that the job was done.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t do this,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this one mg heroin is yours and here are five witnesses who will say we found this in your pocket.&rsquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&quot;I said &lsquo;Okay, give me both the bags and I will do what you say&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Eka took the drugs, went home, injected the lot and tried to hide from the cops.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Two years later, the police raided her house. Her brother, a war veteran from the separatist revolt of Abkhazia, kept a small marijuana plant in the building, which the police found. They also discovered five bullets in the house, illegally kept from a gun used in the civil war.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Eka took the rap for the lot.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;They added in one ball of heroin, put all this together and I collected five years of prison,&rdquo; she says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Eka has spent several periods inside. The last time she won her freedom was in 2011, when she made a final effort to steer clear of the needle and try methadone substitution and therapy.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now she has formed an NGO, Aceso International, for women drug users to help raise awareness about their civil rights and to provide needle and syringe exchange, counselling and support for users.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But she admits that one reason she has stayed more or less free of drugs is because it is tough to find pure opiates in Georgia.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I am trying to stay clean,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Since I left prison, I have only had one three-day binge on heroin.&rdquo;</p>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"d2501e46-3f3c-4aa9-9e62-ee5501367e6c\"}]"}, "pk": 1140, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Inside the corridor one light works, while six others are blown out. We find the lift. Its cabin is deep and nearly pitch-black.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It&rsquo;s occupied - a father clutches his ten year-old son close. When he sees us entering and speaking Russian, he moves his kid further into the shadow.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The lift will not move. There is a rusty and scratched metal box. It needs two ten-cent Georgian Lari coins to move. I pull these out of my wallet and slot them into the mechanism. The elevator jangles upward. But it will only stop at the tenth floor of 14.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;You have to know,&rdquo; says Giorgi. &ldquo;if the police storm the room, everyone inside will be arrested, including you.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the police are following me,&rdquo; I reply.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he laughs. &ldquo;If the police are following you, I will know. I have had experience.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">We leave the lift and mount some concrete steps that rise at the side of the block, giving a view onto the city, framed by the green hills around Tbilisi.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">No windows are here. Only the ghost of a wall that leads onto a sharp&nbsp;drop.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On the eleventh floor, we knock on the door. A slight delay. A dark, heavy-set man of 40 years lets us inside. This is Andrei. He pounces on the bag of needles. There are two others - both in their late 30s - Yuri and Boris. We shake hands. All are unshaven, with short hair and dressed in dark Adidas tracksuits.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Take pictures,&rdquo; Andrei says. &ldquo;But no faces.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">An open plan kitchen and living room. The table is scattered with matches, an empty packet of pills and a bottle of drain cleaner&nbsp;Krot, which in Russian means &lsquo;mole&rsquo;.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A fridge stands with faded stickers of dinosaurs, Spanish striker Raul and Brazilian goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel and a tiny sticker of the five red crosses of the Georgian flag.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The TV is on. Showing the news. Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili is in Washington DC talking with US vice-president Joe Biden. Obama was busy, it seems, and has dispatched Biden to meet with Georgia&rsquo;s&nbsp;head of state, probably due to the defeat for Saakashvili&rsquo;s party in the last parliamentary elections.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I do not want to be on Krokodil,&rdquo; says Andrei. &ldquo;Heroin is much better, but since Saakashvili came to power, we cannot find heroin. I used to take opium, but we cannot find this either - now the only choice is Krokodil.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Andrei has ground up tablets of Codeine-based pain reliever Codasan into a brown powder. He mixes this with the Krot and half a liter of gasoline in an empty plastic beer bottle.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He says he wants to join a programme of taking heroin substitute Methadone, but it is &ldquo;too expensive&rdquo;.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He moves about the room shaking the bottle, while his friend Yuri beckons me over. He has a pile of yellow matchboxes with pictures of zebras. With a razor he is scratching off the side of one, liberating the phosphorus onto a dinner plate.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I ask Yuri about work. If he wants a job.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;There is no work,&rdquo; he says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The other men shake their heads.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Yuri mixes around two grammes of the phosphorus with a flammable alcoholic solution, which he lights up. The flames twist across the dinner plate, leaving a dust stuck to the ceramic, which he scratches off with a razor to make a powder.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Andrei shakes the gasoline to separate the pure codeine from the powdered tablets. His arm is aching.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I ask about the costs of the drug cocktail. Andrei looks at all the bottles, clocking up in mental arithmetic the figure.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Five dollars,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;for each dose.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Inside the&nbsp;bottle, the gasoline floats to the top, the codeine mix to the bottom. He tips this&nbsp;vertical, allowing the heavy mixture to pour into a second, empty&nbsp;coke bottle.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">With Boris holding the base of the beer bottle, Andrei takes a needle to ensure every last drop of the codeine solution is extracted from the mix.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He empties&nbsp;this onto a plate on top of a pan of boiling water and rising steam.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says Andrei proudly. &ldquo;should be desomorphine.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This toxic opiate - an intense version of morphine - is a paste stuck to the plate, which he removes in stripes with a razor. He drops the mixture - similar to a blot of red paint - into a small viol.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Afterwards, the men combine the desomorphine with the black mix of iodine and phosphorus into a solution which they burn on the dinner table over a small flame.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">As the red paste dissolves into a clear yellow liquid, the three men look restlessly at the viol. They share this into three small&nbsp;needles.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I am about to ask Andrei a question, when suddenly the men are standing far from each other, Boris by the window, Yuri in the centre of the room and Andrei facing me.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Their tracksuit bottoms are open and each of them are injecting into a vein above the&nbsp;thigh.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They put down their needles and slump into the chairs. Saakashvili is still on television. Still talking to Joe Biden.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The mood is sullen. No euphoria. No relaxation.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;If only we had heroin,&rdquo; says Andrei.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Before we leave Giorgi looks through the keyhole to check there are no police outside the flat.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;All clear,&rdquo; he says and, easing open the door, he pushes me out into the corridor, whispering &ldquo;Go! Go! Go!&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Later as we drive through the streets, he tells me in every block in this area there are two or three apartments with Krodkodil users. The neighbors complain. The police arrest the users. They spend time in prison. But they go back to using.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Heroin fail</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Because the Georgian government cracked down on the heroin trade, its sale has collapsed in the country - so tens of thousands of opiate users have turned to Krokodil, a drug popular in Russia for the last decade.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;A user is always looking for a substitute,&rdquo; says Giorgi. &ldquo;The moment you get the information that some new drug has appeared that is accessible and cheap, you try it.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Most users in Georgia he meets are injecting Krokodil five times a day.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;All day you are boiling, injecting, boiling, injecting and nothing else,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;At three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, you wake up and you need it. You have pain in your head and in your body. You are mad and sweating. After you use it, you calm down and all this pain is gone. But after a year and half, it does not give you a happy mood or relief. All the time you are in depression and this does not change if you use or not.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A badly mixed batch of Krokodil has gained fame across the ex-Soviet space as a drug which causes oxygen to stop flowing to the extremities of the body.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">If wrongly injected under the skin, this can cause a bruising. Giorgi shows me&nbsp;a large black patch around his ankle bone.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It was almost gangrenous,&rdquo; says Giorgi. &ldquo;I went to hospital. The doctors drained the whole tissue.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Reanimation is possible for users, but amputations are common - and Krokodil users often lose a foot, fingers or a hand.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Giorgi&rsquo;s outreach programme of clean needles reaches about 700 users, most of whom are between 20 and 40 years old - but he is seeing more teenagers starting to use Krokodil.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;In 15 years of using heroin and opium, I have not seen as many cases of overdosing as in one year of using Krokodil,&rdquo; says Giorgi.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Users are now finding out how lethal the drug is.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;90 per cent&nbsp;are willing and eager to get on methadone treatment,\\\" adds the ex- user. \\\"Everyone would like to get rid of it.\\\"</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Small-timers locked up: Saakashvili sought to reconstruct Georgia with an iron fist on petty crime\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Georgia%2010.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 854px; \\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">Counting the cost of zero tolerance</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Before 2003, Georgia was an embattled and corrupt nation losing control to graft-hungry officials, petty thieves and a heroin epidemic.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At home, in the street and in prison,&nbsp;people were desperate to buy, cook and inject the drug.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Following his victory in the Rose Revolution in 2003, incoming President Mikhail Saakashvili re-engineered his war-torn country as a paradise for a reader of The Economist - with open borders, low regulations and strong policing.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now the city honors neo-conservative stars of the last decade - a boulevard is named after dead Polish President Lech Kachinski, another after President George W Bush, whose giant smile&nbsp;and waving hand greet&nbsp;drivers on the wall of an underpass from the airport.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This was a time for entrepreneurs looking for a second chance to thrive - anyone could come to Georgia, change their name, become a local citizen and start a business. This led to strong growth, but high unemployment, which &nbsp;stands at 14 per cent.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile those deviating from puritan ideals - pickpockets, minor tax dodgers and drug users - were shut up in prison.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Under Saakashvili, police swept users off the streets and judges locked them up. The arms of law and order operated an assembly line of targeting, testing and convicting users in a forced detox.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The police knew who the users were - they waited for them outside pharmacies, stopped them and took them to a drug lab for a urine test,&rdquo; says lawyer and project coordinator for NGO Alernative Georgia, Nino Balanchivadze.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At the height of this pressure there were queues of accused users waiting for their turn to urinate in front of a police officer.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Since 2006, around 100,000 have been subject to arrest, detention and forced urine tests - in 2012 alone 25,000 were tested.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"If you were leaning from side to side and looking like a drug user, the police would stop you,&rdquo; says ex-user Giorgi, who was picked up over 50 times.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The police had quotas of drug users to catch and received incentives to seize as many as possible.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;There is a joke,&rdquo; says Giorgi. &ldquo;Two policemen in Tbilisi are sitting in a car. One sneezes. Instead of saying &lsquo;to your health&rsquo;, the other policeman says &lsquo;I hope you catch a lot of junkies&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In terms of prosecution, there was little discrimination between personal use and trafficking, with 1,600 people criminalised annually for up to 20 years, even on possession charges.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">By 2012, Georgia&rsquo;s prisons were hosting 24,500 inmates - a rate higher than Cuba, Belarus or Russia and the highest in the world of a major country after the USA. Around 3,000 from this figure were arrested for drug possession and consumption.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Georgian prison leaders said prison was an effective method to combat addiction because inmates had no contact with drugs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Dealers now rarely&nbsp;exist on the street. Heroin is not available. Neither is poppy, which users can cook into a home-made heroin, popular in Ukraine.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Instead around two-thirds of injecting users are using Krokodil, the remainder are regular users of stimulant Vint - a home-made injectable drug using ephedrine from cold and flu remedies&nbsp;- a cheap Russian version of Meth.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Users can buy the ingredients to make these drugs from pharmacies. Cold and flu drug Actifed became the fourth biggest selling drug in Georgia in 2009, possibly boosted by users of Vint.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile pawn shops appeared around the corner from pharmacies so users could sell off their belongings to buy toxic cough medicine.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Addicts say that now there is only one drug dealer in Georgia - the pharmacy.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Fed up with the crack-down: Tbilisi graffiti sends a message to the cops\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Georgia%2011.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 854px; \\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">However Saakashvili&rsquo;s party has lost control of the Parliament and following the research for this article,&nbsp;his chosen candidate for President will fail to win&nbsp;the election.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Therefore the country is experiencing an aftermath of a decade-long war on drug users.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A war it has lost.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2009 there were 40,000 injecting drug users in Georgia, according to NGO Alternative Georgia, while in 2012, there were 45,000&nbsp;- a 13 per cent rise.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile nine out of ten users prosecuted for possession returned to drug consumption&nbsp;after a year.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Now we have a picture of how restriction and fear of imprisonment does not work,&rdquo; says senior researcher at Alternative Georgia Irma&nbsp;Kirtadze.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Georgia&rsquo;s new Government has drawn up an action plan to combat the rising number of drug users.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But the new powers do not want the reputation of going soft on a part of society that much of Georgia&rsquo;s population has come to despise.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We will keep the severe policy of sanctions under criminal law for traffickers,&rdquo; says Justice Minister Tea Tsulukiani, who chairs an interagency council on drugs. &ldquo;We are determined to continue communicating with the young generation that using drugs is not something which they can be proud of.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But she wants to change the prosecution of the users.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We intend something revolutionary,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;not to decriminalize drug use, but to depenalize it - to reduce sentences for those who are simple users.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">NGOs believe a combination of treatment for sufferers and social assistance would reduce drug use.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;There is an imbalanced policy in favor of law enforcement with no treatment,&rdquo; says lawyer Nino Balanchivadze. &ldquo;Drug use comes out of boredom. There are not a lot of places to have fun and there are few job opportunities in Georgia.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Registered drug users cannot drive a vehicle or work in the public sector - and with 50 per cent of Georgia&rsquo;s workforce employed by the state, this limits their job prospects by half before they even start looking for employment.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Junkie palace</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On a street near the main city hospital, a three-story nineteenth century villa with palm trees in the garden provides counseling, needle exchange and dentistry&nbsp;for addicts.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The New Vector drop-in centre is an open plan space&nbsp;which a&nbsp;mix of older and younger users and ex-users occupy&nbsp;as a chill-out zone to get help on how to quit.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Inside one user is playing patience on a computer, while in the&nbsp;meeting room a whiteboard shows a two-dimensional drawing of the petals of a daisy, next to the words in English - &lsquo;this is a flower&rsquo; and &lsquo;these are the flowers&rsquo; - the traces of a language lesson.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The building is known in the users&rsquo; parlance as the Junkie Palace.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"We were chanting Shame Russia!

I feel I can do something else - aid&nbsp;others - this helps you to quit and to deal with depression.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In Georgia around 500 drug users have free access to Methadone, while a further 1,500 must pay for the opiate substitute.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Users sometimes can afford the drug one month, but not another and they interrupt their programme. The best option would be for methadone to be free for everyone, says Koka Labartkava, manager of New Vector.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The Justice Minister wants to put the emphasis on medical treatment and rehabilitation.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Either you are a user and go through medical treatment that is affordable or you are a trafficker and you go to jail under criminal law, but you will also be treated medically,&rdquo; she says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Because users can easily access the source drugs from pharmacies, one idea is to restrict their sale with greater rigor. But expert Koka is sceptical this would work.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2006, when the heroin market dried up, dealers smuggled into Georgia the opioid substitute Subutex. Once the police cracked down on the Subutex trafficking, cold and flu tablet-based stimulant Jeff became popular.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However when it became clear that Jeff could bring on the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis, users&nbsp;switched to Vint and Krokodil.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;If the pharmacies stop selling drugs, users will always find something else, but much worse,&rdquo; says&nbsp;ex-user&nbsp;George. &ldquo;We are very creative.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">With communication between states&nbsp;open, generations of heavy drug users&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;their experience, information&nbsp;available online and products&nbsp;bought via the Internet&nbsp;or in the drugstore, policy-makers feel&nbsp;they are fighting curiosity.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;You can misuse coffee and get ill,&rdquo; says Tsulukiani. &ldquo;You cannot follow every imagination of the human being. But we need a real state policy against drugs and to minimize our citizens' need to imagine solutions [for creating drugs].&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Giorgi feels he knows&nbsp;where the blame lies.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Recently he organized a protest in front of the Russian Embassy, where he attacked his neighbour&nbsp;as the source of Krokodil and berated Russia for its lack of a methadone programme and free&nbsp;syringe distribution.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We were chanting &lsquo;Shame Russia! Shame Russia!&rsquo;&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;30,000 people died in Russia due to Krokodil. We wanted to express our solidarity with the victims with this protest.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But he concedes that this demonstration was not against trafficking, dealing or the cultivation or production of drugs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Instead it was a new kind of protest - one that targeted the sharing of cooking and injecting skills.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;And that information on how to use,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;comes from Russia.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">- For more on our reporting from Georgia, read <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1143&amp;recType=story\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Paralyzed by home-made alternative to Heroin</a>&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">and <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1140&amp;recType=story\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Smack in the USSR: How injecting drugs in the Soviet Union was socializing</a></p><p style=\\\"\\\">- Parts of the necessary process to create Krokodil have been removed from this article so that it does not act as a guide to cooking the drug.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">- The drug user names have been changed.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">- Thanks to all those quoted above&nbsp;- as well as Minister Archil Talakvadze,&nbsp;Mariam Skhiladze,&nbsp;Ekuna Lolua, Dave Bloss, Dr&nbsp;Dato Otiashvili, everyone&nbsp;at the New Vector clinic, Nanka Nashidashvili and the staff at Monitor&nbsp;and Akaki Gogichaishvili for making this article possible.</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"387c4eca-f8b9-45fb-acfe-f78f3a3c65d6\"}]"}, "pk": 1142, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

It was only enjoyment.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Heroin scarce</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But following Georgia&#39;s&nbsp;Rose Revolution of 2003, incoming President Mikhail Saakashvili launched a war on drugs, cutting off the trade to the country.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This heroin drought forced addicts to switch to whatever drugs they could find.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2007, George learned from his neighbor about a home-made stimulant popular in Russia with ingredients on sale in his local pharmacy - cold and flu drug Actifed and aspirin.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">To activate the ingredients into the bloodstream, users mixed in potassium permanganate - a compound used as a disinfectant and popular&nbsp;in children&rsquo;s chemistry sets as a dye for turning water purple.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;You put everything together and mash it up and in five minutes it is ready,&rdquo; says George.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Known as Jeff, the drug gives a hit for no longer than 15 minutes. For two months Georgia injected&nbsp;Jeff up to five times a day.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Soon his body closed up, his legs were stiff, his speech slowed and his head lost its flexibility.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;After a short time it was difficult to move,&rdquo; he says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Doctors first noticed&nbsp;paralysis among home-made drug users in Estonia in the mid-2000s. Jeff itself is based on the stimulant ephedrine contained in cold and flu remedies. Also known as a &lsquo;methcathinone&rsquo;, the mix is similar to Meth which raged across the States in the last two decades, but has yet to seduce a mass of Europe&rsquo;s addicts.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The problem is that people use potassium permanganate as an oxidation agent to make methcathinone and [people] inject the crude mixture directly,&rdquo; says Simon Brandt, a member of the UK-based Independent&nbsp;Scientific Committee on Drugs (ISCD).</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The potassium permanganate settles on the brain and slowly destroys the protective cover that surrounds nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, known as the myelin sheath.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This attack is similar to the behavior of Multiple Sclerosis.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Because the nerve cells stay without the protection of the myelin layer, the result is a lack of coordination, loss of sensation and paralysis, symptoms which resemble Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It only takes several months of intensive injections to reach this stage and the&nbsp;damage is permanent.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Doctors and harm reduction specialists are wary that Jeff is one weapon in an arsenal of home-made drugs that are causing physical destruction to users across eastern Europe with a ferocity in excess of the damage caused by heroin.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For George, a panacea to the pain was only possible with another drug - Vint, a long acting stimulant using red phosphorus from matchboxes and iodine, but which also contained potassium permanganate.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It gives you relief - it makes you happy - it last for two days,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Coming down you can&rsquo;t sleep. It tires you the next day. I did not sleep for one week because regular taking of Vint. But I liked it very much - it made me move better, it made me walk better.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Following paralysis - prison</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2009, the police stopped George on the street, forced him to take a urine test and searched his house. Inside, they found 0.0043 grammes of heroin.<br style=\\\"\\\" />Despite his physical disability, he was sentenced for up to 14 years on a possession charge, but stayed in prison for only 16 months.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Although he was estranged from his wife, every day he called his kids and had family visits once a month.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">There were no drugs in prison.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I had to cope,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But prison does not change the desire for drugs.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When he came out heroin was still unavailable. Only depressant Krokodil and stimulant Vint were possible to cook up from pharmacy drugs, which he took regularly for three months.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Together they are quite good,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Like heroin and cocaine.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">George found out about the New Vector clinic, a Tbilisi-based NGO which helps to rehabilitate drug users, offering them a chance to reintegrate into the community. It was his chance to get off drugs. &ldquo;After a while, all you have is the need of the drug and not the pleasure,&rdquo; he says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">So what made him stop?</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; says George. &ldquo;Maybe I found out that it is quite damaging. Drugs in Georgia are damaging.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now he runs New Vector&rsquo;s online drugs forum. His paralysis does not mean he cannot work a computer.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">His son is&nbsp;seven and his daughter 14, so she is of an age where she can understand the situation. &ldquo;She is disappointed,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but she loves me. She is happy I work here because I am helping drug users.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">George says if he could go back and change his habits he would never have taken Jeff. But when I push him on whether he regrets that first hit of heroin, he produces a wry smile.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">All users will tell you they have not given up, he adds, that their addiction is just on pause.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Once you know the taste,&rdquo; says George, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite difficult to stay free.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">- For more on our reporting on drugs in Georgia, read: <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1142&amp;recType=story\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Krokodil sinks its teeth into persecuted Georgian drug community</a></p><p style=\\\"\\\">and&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1140&amp;recType=story\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Smack in the USSR: How injecting drugs in the Soviet Union was socializing</a></p>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"22ab6754-630c-4183-b862-c5120dedb523\"}]"}, "pk": 1143, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

It helped him give more boys the chance to take up his lessons. He also spent time visiting the boys&rsquo; parents. Over late-nights around their dinner tables, Roth would speak of their sons&rsquo; physical and emotional development, offering support and advice.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;He was&nbsp;a good psychologist,&rdquo; says Georgiana, the mother of one of Roth&rsquo;s recruits. &ldquo;He understood&nbsp;your needs. We had trust in him.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth would&nbsp;take the boys on minibreaks&nbsp;to other cities for karate tournaments or on holiday&nbsp;&mdash; travel almost none of the kids could afford.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;He was playing a kind of Robin Hood in our village,&rdquo; says Maria, a cosmetician and strip club waitress whose son Cristi was &mdash; and remains &mdash; one of Roth&rsquo;s closest followers.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">To the boys, Roth was a benevolent figure who provided them with free ice cream, soda, pizza and trips to shopping malls.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Most boys we spoke to said&nbsp;they felt special being inside his circle.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Some of the boys spent years with me, came each weekend to me and stayed over,&rdquo; Roth says. &ldquo;They felt more family with me and our group than at home.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Dan, the father of a muscular teen named Rares, recalls the German attending the boy&rsquo;s 14th birthday party in 2009.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The party was recorded that day on&nbsp;Dan&#39;s&nbsp;video camera. But later, the family noticed all recordings in which Roth appeared had vanished.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Their son remembers seeing Roth playing with their camera at the end of the night.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;He always told the kids not to take pictures with him. Ever,&rdquo; says Dan.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Exposed in the pool</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It was autumn 2009. In a close-knit rural community of winding roads, fields and dirt-tracks, when Andrei, a father of a 14 year-old boy, was the first to discover&nbsp;what was happening.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The tip came in a phone call from his cousin, a shepherd, who was tending his flock in a&nbsp;field behind the village.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He heard some screaming and splashing noises from a house and decided to look over the fence to see what was happening.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At first, Andrei didn&rsquo;t understand what his cousin was telling him.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">His teenage son and other village boys were being filmed naked in a backyard swimming pool.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Holding&nbsp;the camera was the polite German karate teacher.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The first to arrive at the house was another father, Liviu, who lived a few doors away. He received a frantic call from Andrei, who was running&nbsp;through the dirt roads of the villages to find his son.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth and the boys had been shooting for 90 minutes when one of his entourage&nbsp;- who Roth had posted as a &ldquo;security guard&rdquo; - warned that an adult was coming.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The two men reached the backyard and ripped down the fence around the pool.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They saw seven boys quickly dressing. Roth was holding the boys&rsquo; underwear and a camera.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He dropped everything and jumped into his car. The two fathers tried leaping on top of the vehicle to stop him.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I chased him through the fields but he got away,&rdquo; says Liviu.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth says he was called by a police officer a few hours later, but only had a &ldquo;calm and friendly&rdquo; chat.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth&nbsp;skipped town. But he did not go far.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Unknown idols</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Later families discovered their sons had become unwitting child stars in hundreds of films viewed by tens of thousands of men around the world &mdash; a network of exploitation and abuse supplied out of a sprawling Toronto warehouse.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Some of these poor Romanian boys had the status of matinee idols to&nbsp;viewers in more than 90 countries.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth had arrived in Romania after serving prison time in his native Germany on a child sex abuse conviction involving young victims he recruited through karate.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A conviction of which&nbsp;no&nbsp;one in Romania was aware.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">With the boys living in&nbsp;Satu Mare county, he took matters further.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He made and sold dozens of films featuring boys as young as eight years old posed naked in ways that a Romanian court ruled in 2010 were &ldquo;explicit,&rdquo; &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; and amounted to child pornography.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Those films are key evidence in a child pornography investigation&nbsp;of internationally-distributed films. <a href=\\\"http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/11/14/toronto_man_charged_in_international_childporn_network_bust.html\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Detectives in Toronto say this is the largest child pornography ring they have ever seen, with 348 arrests made across 90 countries</a>.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They allege the website was operated by a Toronto entrepreneur named Brian Way.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After sifting through hundreds of hours of films, Toronto police charged Way, who is in custody, for child pornography.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Way, through his lawyer in Toronto, declined to comment.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Hundreds of customers are facing &ndash; or have answered to &ndash; charges related to purchasing films from a website called Azovfilms.com. Thousands more are under investigation or facing charges.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><a href=\\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100304174057/http://www.azovfilms.com/popular_picks09.asp\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img alt=\\\"Kid porn buffet: Azovfilms (traces on the Internet Archive)\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/azovfilms.com(1).png\\\" style=\\\"height: initial; width: 966px;\\\" /></a></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">While Roth&rsquo;s whereabouts are unknown even to Romanian police (he is thought to be in Germany), during the research trip in Romania, the Toronto Star reached him through&nbsp;email and telephone interviews during which he confessed his regret&nbsp;for abusing the boys&rsquo; trust.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However he&nbsp;insisted he had committed no sexual abuse in making what he calls &ldquo;naturist&rdquo; films.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;What I did was very wrong and it hurt the boys a lot,&rdquo; Roth says. &ldquo;The boys get older and realize there are nude pictures of them in the Internet, they feel shame in front of their parents, family and everybody who knows&hellip;My regret is fully in my heart.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Late developer</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For six years, between 2001 and 2007, Roth claims he didn&rsquo;t film the boys he was training.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But when the factory where he was working closed in 2007, he needed a new source of cash.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He began to post videos of his karate students in 2007 to a website titled &ldquo;funfightkids.com.&rdquo; which earned him between 1,000 and 2,000 Euro&nbsp;a month, according to the Romanian indictment.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Shortly after, Roth says he received an email from Canada asking him if he would&nbsp;film&nbsp;for a website called Azovfilms.com.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I began to see it as a solution to how I can stay in the country and stay with the boys,&rdquo; Roth says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At first, the&nbsp;films featured the boys in their underwear.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But as trust grew and economic opportunity for Roth increased, he says he was offered more money for films featuring the boys nude.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Andrei&rsquo;s son Emil, now 17, but only 13 at the time of filming, says Roth paid him the equivalent of six USD to film in his underpants - but doubled the amount once he agreed to undress.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;He asked me, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to make more money? If you get naked you&rsquo;ll make more.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Emil says he agreed because: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he was selling them. He told me the movies went to his sister in Germany because she likes to watch them.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In an email Roth sent to his Canadian business partner, obtained by the Toronto Star, he writes of the sales success of a film called Winter Play -thanks to one of the boys having an erection.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;(The boy) has all the weekend long an erection if he is with us, so if you like you can get each week a top seller from me J.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Customers could purchase the videos for 24.95 USD each. As a further &ldquo;stimulus package,&rdquo; customers would receive 1,100 &ldquo;HUGE, super high-resolution&rdquo; photos taken during the filming for 20 USD.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth does not believe the films were pornographic.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;My movies are not classical child porn because there was no real or simulated sexual interaction or behavior,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There was no pressure, no weapons behind the cameras.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/11/14/child_porn_bust_the_woman_who_led_the_hunt_for_predators.html\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Det.-Const. Lisa Belanger, a veteran child pornography investigator</a> with the Toronto Police, spent six months reviewing the cache of films seized after his arrest.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She says Roth&rsquo;s movies were among the most popular and explicit on the website.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;These boys looked very young, no pubic hair, dancing around the room, showering, wrestling, karate, doing push-ups and some included a focus on genitals with full erections.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Satu Mare porn factory</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For three years from 2007 to 2010, Roth kept churning out the videos, while deflecting suspicions and doubts from the families.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth insists he wasn&rsquo;t worried &ldquo;for a single second&rdquo; that the boys would expose him.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We joked together about how we would all be killed by the parents if they knew,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And I was right. It wasn&#39;t the boys who delivered me to the authorities.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In police interviews, one boy said Roth routinely placed a teen at an &ldquo;observation point&rdquo; during filming sessions to alert him if anyone was coming.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Roth taught us that in the event of his arrest by police to deny everything,&rdquo; says one boy.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the end, Roth&nbsp;tripped up on&nbsp;his own ambition.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A 2009 advertisement on Azovfilms foreshadowed for fans what was to come: &ldquo;Construction is underway on a massive farm and soon you&#39;ll be seeing some good old-fashioned outdoor naturist activities with these boys,&rdquo; it reads.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth, helped by the boys, built a playground&nbsp;in the backyard of Maria and Cristi, his closest&nbsp;supporters in the village, including a swimming pool. He&nbsp;recruited local firemen to fill it with water.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The pool remains behind the family&rsquo;s spartan home, surrounded by overgrown weeds and tall grass - a reminder of the day Roth&rsquo;s secret began to unravel.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After being caught by the police and released, Roth moved into an apartment in the nearby city of Zalau. His flat is within a short walking distance from a school where he again succeeded in recruiting and training new boys.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He continued production for another 10 months until 16 August&nbsp;2010, when police pulled over Roth&rsquo;s car with four boys inside &ndash; including Cristi, his cousin and Emil &ndash; heading for Germany.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth had been under police surveillance after they received a tip about him hanging around schools trying to recruit young boys into his karate classes, says&nbsp;Inspector Daniel Puscas, the lead investigator.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We found out&nbsp;about the scandal about parents trying to beat him up in the village,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We got word it was something related to shooting some films.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At the time, they had no information about any link to a Canadian website selling the videos. But the police felt they had to stop Roth from going to Germany.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They found plenty of evidence in the car, including&nbsp;high-tech video gear, tapes and recording devices.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth remained calm and co-operative throughout.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;If you sit down and talk to Markus Roth, in ten minutes he&rsquo;ll convince you of anything,&rdquo; Puscas adds. &ldquo;He has a way to talk very calmly, never raising his voice, very convinced of his arguments.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A police video taken during the&nbsp;raid on Roth&rsquo;s apartment in Zalau reveals hundreds of tapes, wigs and toy swords and shields and&nbsp;a tube of lubricant.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth says he didn&rsquo;t want to fight the police and the prosecutor, so&nbsp;admitted to the allegations of child pornography. This confession helped reduce his sentence to two years.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He was released from prison in August 2012.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Childhood transformed</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Emil&rsquo;s parents say their boy has changed - that he is now&nbsp;uncommunicative, dour and&nbsp;resigned to a quiet life away from others. He has dropped out of high school and is working on a nearby farm.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The whole community was looking at us and pointing the finger,&rdquo; says his father&nbsp;Andrei.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Other families courted by Roth speak of the same lingering sense of humiliation.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A boy named Mihai, only 12 when filmed by Roth, also suffers from anxiety, his parents say.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t afford to go back and forth to Satu Mare where the treatment is,&rdquo; says his mother Claudia.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Sitting on a threadbare couch in a ramshackle farmhouse, 18-year-old Victor stays beside his parents as he explains the disgrace he and his friends felt when they discovered naked images of themselves had been sold around the world.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We had had no idea. I feel very embarrassed,&rdquo; says the teen who was 15 when he spent weekends at Roth&rsquo;s apartment. &ldquo;I was very ashamed in front of the community and friends.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Despite being a convicted sex offender, Roth had access to more than a dozen schools in Satu Mare and Salaj counties - where no one undertook background checks on him. Nobody checked the exact number of schools.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After he was again convicted in a Romanian Court, there was no investigation into how&nbsp;the local&nbsp;education system&nbsp;allowed this to happen and who is responsable.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile the Child protection agency says if&nbsp;a school doesn&rsquo;t ask them for an investigation, they can&rsquo;t do anything.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Plus if a Court did not order Roth to keep away from contacting the boys, he was free to do so after his release. Which he did.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Since the incidents, very few of the&nbsp;children have had&nbsp;comprehensive&nbsp;therapy or psychological assistance.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This is despite the harrowing process of the police investigation, prosecutorial probe and court hearings.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Parents&nbsp;accuse&nbsp;the prosecution of verbally abusing the children and&nbsp;shouting at them to recognize whether&nbsp;what they suffered was sexual abuse.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They were also told&nbsp;not to ask for any financial compensation in Court.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Defending the abuser</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Most of the parents and kids are angry at Roth - but one boy has another view.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Cristi became a well-known draw on the Canadian website, receiving top billing and a steady following.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I have no anger towards (Roth),&rdquo; says the now 18-year-old sitting at his family&rsquo;s dining room table. &ldquo;It was not such a big deal as everyone made out.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In one high corner of the room, a statue of the Virgin Mary looks down. Around Cristi&rsquo;s neck hangs a large crucifix. On the table before him lies a collection of his karate medals.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Roth is the closest to a father Cristi has ever known, say villagers, police, his mother Maria and Roth himself. Roth was presenting Cristi as his son to parents of kids he tried to recruit.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;(Cristi) found trust in me,&rdquo; says Roth, who says he is estranged from a son he fathered in Germany. &ldquo;I feel after so many years responsibility, (maybe) it&#39;s a kind of compensation for other responsibilities which I didn&#39;t take&hellip;In my mind Cristi was, is, and always will be my son.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Maria trusted Roth&nbsp;with her son when they met nearly a decade ago.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He bought Cristi karate outfits and took him on trips, training him for free and providing a strong male presence.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;He came so close to us and I couldn&rsquo;t understand why he would befriend this poor family,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;My impression was that because he had a boy Cristi&rsquo;s age, he was trying to replace his loss.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She now struggles for a metaphor to describe the impact Roth had on Cristi.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;A nuclear bomb,&rdquo; she finally says. &ldquo;Hiroshima. He&rsquo;s a totally different boy. He used to be a very good student. He wanted to prove he could make it being from a poor family. He doesn&rsquo;t have that ambition anymore.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Some have called Cristi &ldquo;gay&rdquo;, she says, which has come with threats of violence in a place where homophobia is widespread. She and Cristi left the village for a long time after the arrest.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Most villagers acknowledge they have shunned Cristi and Maria for bringing Roth into their lives.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now Roth says he leads a quiet life in business administration and says he volunteers helping an elderly man once a week.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He uses the alias &ldquo;Florian Berger&rdquo; in emails and refuses to say where he lives.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I think about (what happened) every day,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;My hope is that the boys get what they deserve in life. I hope they find happiness&hellip; And if a few of them find a way to forgive me sometime, I will die one day much more quietly.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">* Names of boys and their parents were changed. Names of the small villages were left out of the story.</p>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"a399f385-7c5f-44e7-aa30-a715e221654a\"}]"}, "pk": 1145, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

financial crisis gripping Europe. Drug addicts were hit by the downturn and were looking for cheaper alternatives to heroin, which, on the Romanian market, was low in purity.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Legal highs were cheaper than smack and users did not suffer&nbsp;a possession charge if they&nbsp;were arrested by the police.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Back then I didn't know that heroin is like milk compared to legal highs,&rdquo; says Ciobi. &ldquo;Heroin is a thing you can get rid off, with certain withdrawal symptoms, after four or five days. But legals mess you up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ciobi injected brands such as Pure, Magic and Gold Space, all synthetic stimulants usually snorted as a cheap alternative to speed. Head-shops sold them as &lsquo;bath salts&rsquo; or &lsquo;cleaning powder&rsquo;. On the wrapping it was written that they were &lsquo;not for human consumption&rsquo;, which protected&nbsp;merchants from the accusation they were profiting from dangerous drugs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;With Gold Space, the first dose would give me some energy,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The second&nbsp;would entice me to drink, talk or have sex and the third would bring paranoia. But I could never have enough. I could take three doses in two hours. The more I shot, the worse I felt.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ciobi was using the drug daily and often with friends. However they all began to experience&nbsp;symptoms of schizophrenia.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Everyone has his own fear,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;For example, it&rsquo;s five of us in the room and one of us is scared of dogs; then he imagines dogs coming to get him, trying to bite him&nbsp;and,&nbsp;if he sees a dog in the street, then he will climb a tree and stay there for the whole night.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ciobi believed people on public transport were a threat.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I looked at a person in a tram,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They were far from me, but I stared at them. Any gesture they made, I took it personally. If they dropped their keys, in my mind they did it on purpose, to scare me.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This state of mind stopped him from working.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I would be at a wedding with 200 people. The second I took the microphone in my hand, I had the feeling everybody was giving me funny looks and that I was not doing the right thing,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">One time, in front of a table, where a customer was paying for a private song, he&nbsp;seized up,&nbsp;the words and music mute.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The man&nbsp;in charge of the club came over and said: &lsquo;I don't like it, get somebody else to sing.&rsquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But he continued to inject. Whenever he had money in his pocket, he would not buy food, but Legals.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The second I would inject my first dose, my well-being would disappear,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I would hurt myself. Many times I went to the shops crying. I was crying because I knew what was about to happen to me. This remains an enigma. It was like - how could I walk down the street, fall down a sewer-hole, crack my skull, and the next day, go back to the same part of the street, and fall down the same hole?&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Between 2010 and 2012, under new powers to curb the trend in legal high use, Romania&rsquo;s police raided the head-shops, gaining the right to shut them&nbsp;down.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However some store-owners took their stash and sold drugs out of their car, around the corner from where the shops used to be. &ldquo;The business turned from retail into wholesale,&rdquo; says Ciobi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The dealers began to mix the Legals with other chemicals, such as chlorine, Ciobi argues.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;My vein were shriveled, like a pair of trousers that fits at first, but shrinks after washing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Meanwhile I would sweat with the smell of chlorine.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Knocked out loaded</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the beginning of 2012, Ciobi was on the street, injecting a strong packet of powder of the now illegal stimulant. The moment after the needle left the vein, he fell on the street on his left side and could not move.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Although in pain, he woke up and made his way home, but fell down again in on the pavement.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He says a Spanish guy walking past helped him get to the Accident and Emergency of a hospital in north Bucharest.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I try to push him on who this was and how he knew he was Spanish, but Ciobi will&nbsp;not give further details.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He seems to think&nbsp;it is natural for the Spanish to be wandering through Bucharest, prepared to take pity on overdosing addicts in the middle of the street.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the hospital, Ciobi&nbsp;could not swallow. His muscles and larynx were paralyzed. A CT scan showed that he had experienced a minor stroke.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He points to the left side of his face.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;When I put the razor to my face to shave myself, I do not feel anything,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I can hear, but can&rsquo;t feel my face. If I slap myself on the right side, it hurts, but here, on the left, I can hit myself with a hammer. I don&rsquo;t feel a thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For months a bizarre mental state seemed to force him to charge into passers-by.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I had the tendency to fall over couples,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;for example if you were to walk&nbsp;by with your girlfriend, I would fall over her. You would say: &lsquo;What are you doing? Are you touching my girl&rsquo;s breasts?&rsquo; By the time you realized that I was sick, you would have punched me.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Moving on up</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">His body near-arthritic, his speech stuttering, his gait confused and his weight dropping to only 53 kilogrammes, Ciobi arrived at the Parada foundation, which has a small gymnasium with mats and exercise equipment.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Every day, he started to do gymnastics, pantomime and break-dance, working with performers, disadvantaged children and street kids. Here Ciobi had access to meals, a daily bath and clothes. Soon he gained 17 kg in weight.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ciobi shows me the gym. A carpeted room with plastic equipment, lockers and naive murals on the walls of rain-clouds, apple trees and hedgehogs. Children run through the space, throwing juggling balls at one another. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Standing up straight in the centre of the room, Ciobi moves his hands and his head in a rigid imitation of a robot, performing a medley of pop, lock and wave moves popular among 1980s dancers.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He lies face-down, close to the carpet, held up by his bent arms. Turning to the left, he makes the first two or three moves of a breakdancing spin. Getting up, against a mural of a countryside scene, he stands on his head, his face red and strained, but after a few seconds, he eases himself down. Standing up again, he throws three skittles into the air, which propel for a few turns, before falling to the ground.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Sweat runs down his forehead. He needs to sit down.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Slowly I recovered my physical health,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However Ciobi cannot sing anymore.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I try,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Some people forget the words, but I forget the melody. When I sing it is like I am combining two songs into one.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Street life</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ciobi spends the day at the centre. At night he lives on the streets. In summer, he stays in a park in Piata Minis in east Bucharest, where he is comfortable sleeping rough.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;There are people who live there who know me and know I used to be a normal person,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Any bench I sleep on, no one says anything, because I am a clean person. All policemen who come and ask for my ID, they know me.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When it rains outside, he cannot sleep in the open air. &ldquo;Then I go to the apartment block where I used to have a flat,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and I sleep on the staircase.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ciobi has a teenage daughter. Her mother died at 29, when the child was eight. Now she lives with her grandmother. Ciobi also&nbsp;stayed in the flat with them. But when he was on Legals, he says &ldquo;nothing else mattered&rdquo; and he was reckless with his injecting equipment. One day his daughter found a syringe in the bathroom.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I said to myself that instead of appearing like that in front of my kid, I&rsquo;d better leave,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At this point Ciobi&rsquo;s eyes moisten.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">There are holes in the sides of his sneakers. He has a telephone, which he pulls out to show me. A chunky black Nokia from a decade ago, grey with bruises and scratches. It works, but needs a Simcard. He wants to call his daughter.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But he has no cash.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He complains that he needs to walk and he needs to talk. He points to his phone and to his shoes. Right now he can&rsquo;t do either of these.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He moves his head about, then mumbles something I cannot understand.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I am not sure what he is asking for, but make a guess.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Money,&rdquo; I ask? &ldquo;Do you want money?&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He doesn&rsquo;t answer.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I take this as an affirmation.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I tell him it is not ethical for journalists to give money to people they interview.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But he has suffered decades of substance abuse, as well as a physical and mental breakdown and is now living on the streets, so what does he care about journalistic ethics?</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I think about the horrible situation this puts us both in.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I will only give you money if you put it to good use,&rdquo; I say, but I sound sanctimonious. &ldquo;You must buy a simcard for your phone and some shoes.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Yes, I am aware this is a pathetic liberal compromise.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I give him 100 RON, about 25 Euro.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">There is a caveat.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I tell Ciobi he must use it to call me when he gets a new number.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">What about the future, I ask. This can be a cynical question to put to someone who does not have an address, a job or his health. It can sound like I am teasing.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He says he wants to regain his fitness and work on a construction site or as a security guard.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But due to his sickness, he runs out of energy.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t understand that for me a day of work equals ten days for another person,&rdquo; he argues.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But he says he has the determination to continue a clean life, to get back on track and never to go back to Legal Highs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I must go forward,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;at least like a man.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ciobi has to leave.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He must rehearse for a performance with Parada at the French Ambassador&rsquo;s residence.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Holding my hand tightly in farewell, he looks away and says he will call me.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Did he call me?</p><p style=\\\"\\\">What do you think?</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">- All photos by Michael Bird</p><p style=\\\"\\\">- Thanks to Valentin Simionov, Corina Mica, Aurore Iacobescu&nbsp;and Parada for making this article possible.</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"d6c882e7-2885-4341-a90a-1e3878c86110\"}]"}, "pk": 1146, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Through the open apartment doors are members of 12 families, from toddlers wearing bibs to old women in traditional kerchiefs, village neighbors and other visitors, gathered around the table, talking and laughing.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;At Christmas we slaughter a pig and make caltabos [a sausage made from lungs, liver, mixed with rice and spices], just like in Romania,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;This is how we enjoy ourselves: birthdays, weddings and christenings. It&rsquo;s the same back home. We&rsquo;ve never had a vacation.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Cotros is part of the vanguard of the work migrants from Romania following 1989. After the fall of Communism, when the Romanian centralized production system collapsed and work opportunities in the country vanished, the people of Oas were the first to jump the border in search of work - and willing to do any job going.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Cotros grew up with 17 brothers and a father who had a saying: be optimistic, brave and look forward. And this is how your life is going to be.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;And it has been so,&rdquo; he says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Lica has been working cleaning houses in Paris for 15 years (photo &Acirc;&copy; Petrut Calinescu)\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/article3/2(1).jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 921px;\\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Lifetime working away</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 17 years since he has been&nbsp;in Paris, Cotros has taken his wife Lica&nbsp;to a restaurant only once. Even now they fight over the money they spend.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Lica left her&nbsp;home in Oas at 14, took a bus which every summer carried seasonal workers from the villages in her region&nbsp;around the country. Since then she has not stopped working away.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She has now been&nbsp;cleaning houses in France for 15 years. This has not given her&nbsp;the time to be a mother to her two sons and daughter.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I grew up without parents,&rdquo; says Dana Ciocan, 28, the daughter of Lica and Cotros.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">While her parents left to work abroad, she stayed at home in Oas to take care of her brothers.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do as much crying when they left as I did when they took my elder brother to work with them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;My God, how I cried when he left.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When she was 16, she joined them in Paris to work.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;In the beginning, my mom would take me with her to houses where she cleaned, so I would learn the job,&rdquo; says Dana.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It was so hard for me. In Oas, we had the toilet in the backyard. I had never seen a bathroom. So entering one terrified me. I didn&rsquo;t even know how to turn on the water. And when mom first put&nbsp;all the cleaning solutions in my arms, the smells made me vomit instantly... I would clean and vomit, clean and vomit.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Like her mother, Dana is now a successful housekeeper. On average, she earns 2,500 Euro per month.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Like her father has taught her, she saves 2,000 and lives on 500.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Generations of Romanians bunk-up in blocks in the suburbs of Paris (photo &Acirc;&copy; Petrut Calinescu)\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/article3/4(1).jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 921px;\\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Decade of temporary living</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The apartment where Cotros and Lica live has two rooms furnished with a wardrobe, bunk beds and a few wicker chairs for guests, which are also used as tables.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">There is a TV always set to the most popular Romanian entertainment channel, ProTV.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Despite decades abroad, the Romanians here do not seem to have changed the atmosphere of a temporary residence.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At first, Cotros&rsquo;s entire family lived in this small apartment, but once the grandchildren were born, the young families started to occupy other apartments in the building or moved to other neighborhoods around Paris.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When they left Romania after 1989, the people of Oas didn&rsquo;t know the first thing about construction, which is now their main profession in Paris.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But they could do the work of many people, carry materials on their back without complaining, sleep on wooden boards or in the open air and not see their children for months.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They had proven this durability back in the Communist period, when the authorities hired them for seasonal work, including difficult but well-paid jobs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ceausescu wanted Romania to become the granary of Europe, so used people from the north of his country to clear the forests to make way for agricultural land.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This was undertaken by people from Oas, who also cleaned petrol tankers and painted telegraph poles. These workers would do anything in return for good pay.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 1994 Cotros and his colleagues fled Romania under train wagons and in airless vans, hunted by the dogs of the border patrol through&nbsp;Hungary, Austria and Germany.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the beginning they lived on the outskirts of Paris, in improvised cabins or abandoned houses, because nobody would take them in as tenants.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Many Romanian work migrants live in temporary accommodation at the edge of the French capital (photo &Acirc;&copy; Petrut Calinescu)\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/article3/paris09.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 921px;\\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After seven years of a semi-vagabond existence, an Arab with a knack for real estate offered them a three-story abandoned building. Cotros and a team of people from Oas, eager to work, helped finish the construction.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;From the start, the deal was that we&rsquo;d make the apartments ourselves,&rdquo; says Cotros.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now&nbsp;the people from Oas are renowned on the French labour market as among the best construction workers, but in the beginning they renovated the building as they thought fit.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">No two apartments were alike. Some they built with two rooms, others with three. They took down and put up walls depending on the size of their families.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;When we were done, we finally moved in and paid rent, like normal people,&rdquo; says Cotros. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s just people from Oas in this building. Somehow, we made it so that we&rsquo;d all fit in.&rdquo;</p><p class=\\\"p2\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Remaining Romanian</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Even after 17 years of working in Paris, Cotros doesn&rsquo;t speak French well. But he&rsquo;s not ashamed. He tells everyone how he went to the doctor with a pain in his eyes and the doctor prescribed eye-drops.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However, because he misunderstood what the doctor told him, he ended up drinking the drops.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Why should he speak French anyway? His direct boss is his youngest son who&rsquo;s recently turned 23 and has a small construction firm. Business is going pretty well. He works ten hours a day with teams of people from Oas. He spends Sundays with his family or visiting neighbors from the village who have also settled in Paris.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now Cotros&rsquo;s only wish is to return home. He&rsquo;s going to stay a few years &ldquo;to get his retirement money&rdquo; and then he&rsquo;ll go back to Certeze in north Romania, where he wants to set up a pheasant farm.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\\\"p2\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Old Bumbuschi has built a house in Romania from selling street newspapers on Ave Charles de Gaulle (photo &Acirc;&copy; Petrut Calinescu)\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/article3/5(1).jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 921px;\\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Only job going - selling newspapers</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When they first came to Paris, many people from Oas embraced the temporary legal status of being socially excluded (SDF &ndash; without fixed residence and a work permit) offered by the French state.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">One of the only jobs available to them was selling &lsquo;street newspapers&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They quickly built up an efficient and crafty newspaper distribution network, succeeding in making concealed beggary a prosperous business. In the 1990s, they made at least 50 <span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Deutschmarks</span> per day, the bulk of which they sent to Romania.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Old Bumbuschi from Certeze, his eyes red from conjunctivitis, stands at the entrance of the Monoprix shop on Av. Charles de Gaulle, with a view to La Defense esplanade, the central business district of Paris.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Every day for 17 years, untroubled by the security guards, Bumbuschi has been here, selling street newspapers.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">People have known him for so long, that he&rsquo;s become emblematic of the place.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He proudly says that with the money earned here, he has built for himself in Certeze houses for his children - and a house for himself, bigger than a church. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Today other Romanians still sell street newspapers, but most have legal papers and have switched to working in&nbsp;construction and housekeeping - like Irina Solomes, known as &lsquo;Jaga&rsquo;, from Tarsolt.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I lived in abandoned houses in Paris and sold newspapers at shop entrances,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I did make money&hellip; but, my God, I was so ashamed&hellip; In those days, there was no talk of actual work. Around 1996, I returned home to Romania from Paris after nine months. I missed my child, who I had left with my sister.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But she soon returned to France and has been a housekeeper for over 15 years. She loves antique furniture and, from her French employers, she collects objects, which she uses to decorate the house in her home village.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;People know I&rsquo;m a fashionable person,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This year I have changed the curtains in the house. It&rsquo;s the latest style here in the region. The plate, glass and crystal sets&hellip; I brought them all from Paris. I just hate the kitchen I have now. I&rsquo;m going to change it! Here fashion changes from one year to the next. Now I&rsquo;m simply embarrassed, I can&rsquo;t even look at it. I&rsquo;ve already changed the chairs three times. The ones I have now are no longer in style. They were very expensive. Now I have to change these too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Irina says that if the French ladies she works for could see her house, they would think they should be doing the housekeeping for her.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img a=\\\"\\\" alt=\\\"&acirc;&#128;&#156;People know I am a fashionable person,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Irina from Tarsolt (picture &Acirc;&copy; Petrut Calinescu)\\\" am=\\\"\\\" as=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" fashionable=\\\"\\\" from=\\\"\\\" i=\\\"\\\" irina=\\\"\\\" know=\\\"\\\" me=\\\"\\\" oasului=\\\"\\\" people=\\\"\\\" petrut=\\\"\\\" photo=\\\"\\\" say=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/article3/6.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 921px;\\\" tara=\\\"\\\" tarsolt=\\\"\\\" that=\\\"\\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Concrete hex</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Even before the anti-Communist revolution of 1989, the people of Oas invested the bulk of their money in houses.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When Romania was reaching the poverty threshold in Ceausescu&rsquo;s extreme plan to pay off the country&rsquo;s external debt, the villages of Oas were prospering. Their bungalows were &ldquo;growing&rdquo; a first floor.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now the money the residents earned in France has changed the face of traditional villages in north Romania.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Before the villages were full of wooden houses, renowned for their technical genius because builders could fasten the slats and beams together without using nails.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now the area is packed with concrete mansions with stainless steel balconies and curved roofs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At the heart of these new builds lies the old houses.

The first one, in traditional costume, is held at the bride&rsquo;s house and is called the bride&rsquo;s wedding, and the second, in &lsquo;royal clothes&rsquo;, is held at the village wedding house.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The adorning of the bride starts two days ahead and the longest procedure is the hair weaving, a technique known only to a few women in the village.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The weaving uses industrial margarine to grease the hair to make it easier to plait - a process which takes eight hours over two days.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Maria Veletean from Certeze is one of the few women who still know how to weave the bride&rsquo;s hair. She earns around 9,000 Euro in the month of August just for the weaving.

The brides stay dressed in this clothing for roughly ten hours.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Under the scorching August sun, the bride often turns white and has to sit somewhere in the shade so as not to pass out.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She is left with a severe pain in her ribs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In some villages, after the first wedding, the bride is left to rest for a few days, so that the wounds and bruises from the shoes and the traditional bride costume she wears can heal, before she is ready for the second ceremony.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"The wedding of Ionut and Maria Certeze, Oas county.

And so they painted it.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A burly man in his late thirties, with blue eyes and closely cropped blond hair and a receding hairline, dressed in a plain blue shirt and denims, old unlaced boots on his feet, Sawicki is a cattle farmer who has decided to pick a fight against shale gas development in his region.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On his isolated homestead, nestled among bucolic pastures, rolling woodlands, and limpid lakes, he is known locally as one of the most implacable opponents of gas drilling.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I follow him across the yard. Two shiny tractors are parked on the far side. The unhitched plows and trailers are clean. A pile of perfectly stacked logs lies next to a new grain silo gleaming in the noon sun. A large plaque stamped with the flag of the European Union, an organic-farm certificate, is mounted on the outer wall of the living quarters. Somebody loves this place.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Sawicki&rsquo;s living room is airy and spacious, large windows overlooking a sunlit lawn. Framed icons of Jesus and Mary hang on one of the walls. A large flat-screen Panasonic TV has been mounted across the room. Plush leather-upholstered couches surround a varnished wooden table stacked with sweets and cakes and tea.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We have to take some snuff first,&rdquo; he says, grinning, and hands me what looks like a miniature powder horn engraved with a heraldic lion and the word&nbsp;Kasz&euml;b&euml;.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;This is a tradition in Kashubia,&rdquo; he adds. He shows me how to tap out snuff&mdash;&ldquo;cow tobacco,&rdquo; he calls it&mdash;on the back of my hand.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I try a sniff. The pleasant, minty rush in my nostrils takes me aback.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Welcome to Kashubia.&rdquo; He laughs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Kashubia is a small linguistic enclave in Poland with no special administrative status, but which prides itself on a spirit of independence and cultural autonomy.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It is the reason why road signage in the area has two spellings, Polish and Kashubian, and why a black-and-yellow Kashubian flag, a pirate twin of the white-and-red one of Poland, flies in the region. The residents of Warsaw like to joke that Kashubs are the country bumpkins of the north.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The Kashubs don&rsquo;t care.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">With his rough stubble and piercing in his left ear, Sawicki resembles a buccaneer more than a farmer. Military valor at the Battle of Vienna won his family the estate in 1683, when a local duchess made them gentry and granted them 400 hectares (nearly 1,000 acres) in gratitude for their loyalty and service&mdash;in fighting to save Europe from the threat of the Ottoman Empire. Though reduced to sixty hectares (nearly 150 acres) today, the farm somehow survived the chaos of Polish history, the fire of wars and the ice of revolutions, the invasions of Prussians and Russians during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Nazis and Soviets in the twentieth. But, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, there was a new enemy at the door.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Edward Sawicki on his ancestral farm in the hamlet of Ogonki, Poland.

No other energy topic has garnered so much media attention in the last few years.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Companies and politicians and economists have lauded it as a solution to the shrinking reserves of fossil fuels. Studies show there may be hundreds of years of global supply. Most importantly, shale gas is abundant in different geographies, from the US to China to Argentina to Indonesia to eastern Europe.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But the global rush for shale gas has also sparked global opposition, from both groups and individuals, as environmental problems have come to proliferate at every stage of extraction.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Unlike conventional natural gas, which collects in large underground reservoirs that are relatively easy to tap, the extraction of gas from shale&mdash;a rock with very low permeability&mdash;requires an invasive technique called high-volume slick-water hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After the completion of drilling, slickwater, also known as fracking fluid (a special mixture of several million gallons of water, fine sand, and chemicals) is injected under enormous pressure into a well in order to fissure the shale and release the trapped methane gas.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Of the large amounts of water used in the fracking fluid, about a quarter of it comes back to the surface as &ldquo;flowback&rdquo; and brine, bearing not only the original chemicals but also high concentrations of salts, as well as heavy metals and, on occasion, weak radioactivity.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Since the byproduct is difficult to treat, it is often pumped into plastic-lined tailings pits or into deep-injection wells underground, though in some cases it is now recycled.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Shale gas drilling also necessitates a high density of wells&mdash;clusters of drilling pads pockmarking huge geographical areas.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Then, there are new access roads to each pad, impoundment ponds for frack water, compressor stations that burn enormous amounts of diesel fuel&nbsp;and thousands of miles of new pipelines cutting through woods and fields. And tanker trucks, of course&mdash;as many as a thousand tanker-truck trips per well.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The more Sawicki learned about the process of shale gas extraction, the more he came to think of it as his private apocalypse.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He read all the articles in Polish he could find on the Internet. He watched&nbsp;Gasland, an Oscar-nominated documentary about shale gas and associated water contamination in the United States.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He looked at statistics and academic papers. A bachelor with extra time on his hands, he slowly turned into a self-made expert in the field, ready for a battle.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For that was how he conceived of it: an invasion of his family estate by multinational corporations and the Polish government. And for the destruction of his known world, he was not going to receive any compensation, since mineral rights in Poland belong not to individuals, but to the state.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When representatives of the state-owned seismic company Geofizyka visited him in August 2011 to ask to use his private road to conduct geological studies on the land, Sawicki declined permission, even though many of his neighbors had already consented.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The visits did not stop, however, as California-based BNK Petroleum, which owned the local concession, joined in the public-relations campaign. Shale gas, they assured him, did not present a danger to his land and water. He was given leaflets and brochures attesting that no toxic chemicals are involved in fracking.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It would be just citric acid, one company representative told him, &ldquo;just like lemon juice.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I imagine them sitting at the rig with a juice extractor and pouring lemon juice,&rdquo; he says, a sarcastic note in his voice. &ldquo;I guess the chemicals are so harmless that in case of water contamination we will have lemon-flavored water.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Even though he had explicitly refused to have seismic testing done on his property, he was given an official document, where, in place of his personal signature, somebody had written &ldquo;oral consent,&rdquo; giving a go-ahead to the operation.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He was furious. Together with a couple of neighboring farmers and homeowners, he organized an opposition movement.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Visiting artists came to paint the mural on his barn. Several rallies took place, most of them with just a few enthusiasts, though others were bigger. In March 2012, about 200 locals showed up at a rally in the nearby village of Klukowa Huta, where a well was being drilled.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Then, after an impromptu blockade of the seismic trucks that had come to his area, Sawicki started receiving anonymous messages on his cell phone.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He was accused of being a Russian collaborator, a national traitor. &ldquo;Go save flamingoes and orcas,&rdquo; one message said.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Shale gas drilling pad in northern Poland.

A couple of his cows follow us, like faithful dogs. Although it is the middle of October, the grass is so green it hurts the eyes.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Forests of oak and beech and birch form a darker band in the distance. Beyond the forests, beyond our sight, the deep lakes of Kashubia reflect a blue sky.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Nothing has changed in Poland since communism in terms of human rights and attitude towards common people,&rdquo; he tells me reflectively.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;People have no impact. They might have maybe a bit more money, things are a bit more colorful, but it&rsquo;s the same political system and there is the same disregard for people.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">His fighting spirit seems on the breaking point. After a year of campaigning against shale gas, he feels tired.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Few are paying him any attention now, and some of his neighbors have stopped supporting him. They think shale gas development is doomed to happen, whether they like it or not. Everybody feels intimidated by different factors: the government or the media or the company. His friends ask him:&nbsp;What is the point of opposing the inevitable?</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;If we wait to see the full impact of shale gas, it will be too late,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There will be no life for us.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">We pass a large wooden crucifix by the side of the road, next to a tractor trailer stacked high with hay bales. Sawicki looks at them.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;If you ask me why I am fighting, I&rsquo;ll tell you. I am a simple man, and my philosophy is to leave the slightest trace possible on this Earth.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Bradford County, Pennsylvania</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Morning fog floats over the valley of the Susquehanna River like a twin, ghostly river.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Driving in my rented Nissan Tiida over a long, concrete bridge, I feel like I am in a submarine, water and air blending into a uniform milky white. The early November chill has frosted the forests on both banks, making them look like eerie, albino coral reefs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">My car climbs up a winding, two-lane country road, and the fog begins to thin out. Blue patches of sky flash over as I emerge into another world: the Allegheny Plateau of Bradford County, in northern Pennsylvania.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Green rolling hills open up on all sides, a patchwork of forests, pastures&nbsp;and freshly tilled earth. Here and there, the tall silos and red barns of dairy farms, scatterings of cows grazing around them, break up the geometric patterns of the land. Weathered gravestones rest in the grass next to clapboard churches.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But deeper into the countryside, other shapes begin to materialize&mdash;one, five, ten&mdash;shattering the pastoral.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Huge tanker trucks and pickups with Texas and Arkansas plates whoosh up and down the country roads. Large white pipes with complex systems of valves run along the ground, cutting straight through fields and woods.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I see rectangular ponds, as big as swimming pools, filled with water. Every mile or so, there are gravel lots the size of football fields, with rows of yellow containers and white storage tanks, resembling a gigantic circuit board. When I turn off the engine of my car for a second, I can hear a buzz, a hiss: the endless exhalation of methane.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Shale gas drilling pads. Impoundment ponds. Pipelines. They are everywhere.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"The shale gas boom in Pennsylvania has resulted in drilling in the midst of agricultural, forest, and even residential areas. Well pads, such as this one, are common.

By the end of 2012, four years into the rush, there were more than 6,000 wells, with tens of thousands more in the planning stages.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Thousands of miles of pipelines and gathering lines were laid to deliver the gas to metropolitan markets on the East Coast, while new compressor stations, like behemoth hearts, kept the gas moving through the steel veins.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This was not the first fossil-fuel fever in the state: In 1859 the first commercial oil well in the United States was drilled near Titusville, Crawford County, by Edwin Drake.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Then there was coal extraction, one of the biggest mining operations in the world, giving Pennsylvania the nickname of &ldquo;the coal state.&rdquo; The shale gas boom, however, has proved to be an entirely different enterprise, fully decentralized, not confined to industrial zones or areas of intensive development like in the past, but dispersed among residential communities, next to houses, farms, schools, retirement homes, churches and&nbsp;cemeteries.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Bradford County -&nbsp;until that point a quiet, agricultural community of 63,000 in northern Pennsylvania -&nbsp;suddenly became the economic epicenter of the Marcellus, the sweet dry gas under the farmlands proving irresistible for the tastes of companies.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Nearly 2,000 shale gas wells have sprung up here, making it the most drilled county in the state. In 2010, the industry invested about 2.4 billion USD in Bradford, larger than the total size of its economy in 2009, which was 1.8 billion USD. So far, local landowners have received 160 million USD in leases and royalties.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But as money began to flow, so did pollution.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For the shale gas industry statewide, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has recorded more than 3,000 violations.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">While many violations are administrative in nature, numerous others involve gas migration, water contamination, and well blowouts.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Chesapeake Energy, the company with the most substantial local presence, was fined 900,000 USD -&nbsp;the largest environmental fine in the state&rsquo;s history -&nbsp;for allowing gas to seep into the water of sixteen families in the county in 2010.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Later, a blowout of a Chesapeake well caused large amounts of fracking fluids to spill into the local Towanda Creek. The industry itself calculated in 2003 that about six&nbsp;per cent of all new wells experience a problem with the cementing or casing (the pipes in the borehole), a serious issue which could lead to dangerous substances leaking into the water table.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The county has thus far seen more than 600 shale gas-related violations.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Today, temporary water storage tanks -&nbsp;known as &ldquo;water buffalo&rdquo; -&nbsp;sit in many front yards, where groundwater has been contaminated by drilling activities. Expensive gas filtration systems have been installed in house basements to make well water safe for human and animal consumption. None of these steps were supposed to be necessary.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But, for many local residents, they are a way of life now. The idyll seems to be over: Bradford County, Pennsylvania, has become a land under siege.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The farm of Carol French is the main bastion of resistance, even though it looks no different than any other farm in Bradford County: a two-story white clapboard house next to an assembly of red barns and grain silos, agricultural machinery and implements scattered around.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On a gently sloping pasture in the back, a few hens and cows take in the last warmth of the season.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I pull into a small gravel lot and walk to the front porch, where the landowner is already awaiting me. A golden retriever barks feebly at me, wagging its tail.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t get lost,&rdquo; French says and gives my hand a strong shake. &ldquo;Some people have difficulty finding my place.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Carol French on her dairy farm, taking care of her milk cows.

She wears old blue jeans and a T-shirt stamped with a snowy mountain peak and a lonely log cabin in the foreground. Sisters Quilt Show, it says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She invites me to sit down at a round table in the kitchen. Around us, mounted on the walls, are taxidermied deer heads and framed deer paintings.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The chandelier above the table is made of interlaced stag antlers, like a crown of thorns. In the far corner of the adjacent living room I can see a cabinet holding several hunting rifles.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;My sister got murdered by her partner in a domestic dispute recently,&rdquo; she tells me, as if this is the most natural way to open a conversation with a new guest.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It was a very abusive relationship, and I didn&rsquo;t realize how bad it had all been until it was too late.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I sit silent for a few seconds. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I manage to mumble.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Farmers and gas companies are in the same kind of abusive domestic relationship,&rdquo; she finally says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I see it.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Her rocky relationship with the industry began in 2006, when she and her husband leased their mineral rights to a gas company, a one-time payment of 85 USD per acre on a total of 160 acres.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It was a period of excitement and optimism, as they hoped that the extra cash would give a much-needed boost to the dairy operation and help the family cope with the habitually low milk prices.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">There were promises of new jobs, new roads, and maybe additional money from royalties, if a well was drilled on their property. Everyone in the region talked of the new gas bonanza, the airy invisible gold, which would turn farmers into &ldquo;shaleionaires.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Shale gas was the solution to all the problems of Bradford County -&nbsp;many residents, including the Frenches, welcomed companies with open hands.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The first shale gas well near the French family farm was drilled in December 2010, followed by two more, then five more. Their property did not get a lucky well -&nbsp;initially a big disappointment -&nbsp;but something else happened instead.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On March 15, 2011, their water &ldquo;turned.&rdquo; From a pure, transparent liquid, the tap started spewing a milky white mixture. When French left the water to settle, it formed a layer of sand at the bottom with a greenish moss-like substance over it, then later stabilized to the consistency of gelatin.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">During her twenty years on the farm she had never seen or experienced anything like it.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;This is what my water looked like at the time,&rdquo; she says and hands me a jar with a lid on top. I shake it up, and it turns the same pearly white color she described.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Soon after the water went bad, the whole family started experiencing skin rashes -&nbsp;French lifts up her arms to show me small red splotches on her pale skin. Some of the cows had similar dermatological issues.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Then, in October 2011, her twenty-three-year-old daughter suddenly fell sick with high fever, diarrhea, and acute stomach pains, losing ten pounds in a week.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At the hospital the doctors determined that she had an enlarged spleen, liver, and right ovary, but they could not find a cause for the ailments. When a few neighbors (whose water had also &ldquo;turned&rdquo;) began suffering similar health problems, French decided that, whatever the origin of the illnesses, it was time to send her daughter away to a healthier environment -&nbsp;where she quickly improved.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;At one meeting we were told that we all, as Americans, need to accept shale gas and make a sacrifice for the energy independence and prosperity of our country,&rdquo; French tells me, as I sit across the table from her.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;But why should we be the sacrificial lambs? At the end of all this, we got to see our farm lose much of its value. We are losing our milk market, and probably I won&rsquo;t be able to sell our cows. We lost our health. We lost our daughter,&rdquo; she says, her sentences becoming more clipped. &ldquo;We lost.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Gas infrastructure in Bradford County, Pennsylvania.

She joined forces with a neighbor, Carolyn Knapp, an organic dairy farmer who lives a quarter of a mile up the road and who had also come to experience firsthand the effects of shale gas development.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Together they turned into vocal opponents of fracking -&nbsp;Bradford&rsquo;s unlikely dissidents.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The two women began spending hours in the courthouse of Towanda, the county seat, where they leafed through thousands of pages of deeds, leases, statistics and&nbsp;directional drilling logs -&nbsp;trying to find as much information as possible about the gas-industry practices.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They read through all the studies and documents they could track down and contacted preeminent experts in the field. Soon, the two were touring small communities in Pennsylvania and New York, giving PowerPoint presentations, writing essays for local publications, telling their stories to the media.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Some farmers in the area called them dismissively &ldquo;the two environmentalists,&rdquo; but they did not seem to care. Shale gas development was too big of a juggernaut to stop, but they would at least educate people about the dangers from their point of view.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Watching YouTube videos of their lecture tours, one is struck by their wide-ranging knowledge of the legal, economic, and environmental aspects of shale gas development -&nbsp;two farmers from rural Pennsylvania turned shale polymaths.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They discuss technical subjects such as &ldquo;mechanic&rsquo;s lien&rdquo; and &ldquo;subordination&rdquo; and &ldquo;attornment agreements.&rdquo; They talk about the social effects of the local gas boom -&nbsp;the increase in crime, rental prices, traffic accidents, as well as the strain on emergency services.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">They compare job creation in the gas and renewable-energy industries. They say a few good words about shale gas extraction too, but, from their point of view, the negatives far outweigh the positives.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;This house is where I raised my babies,&rdquo; French tells me, when I ask her about her motivation to fight shale gas development. &ldquo;This is my home, where I made my memories. That&rsquo;s where your heart is. In my mind, it is worth fighting for.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Youngstown, Ohio</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The earthquake hit Youngstown, Ohio, at 3:04 in the afternoon of December 31, 2011.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Windowpanes rattled, furniture shook, plates fell off kitchen shelves. Glass ornaments were flung off Christmas trees and shattered on impact.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Anxious residents ran out of their houses, carrying their young children. In stores, post-holiday shoppers froze in panic.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Then the shaking stopped, as suddenly as it had begun. Everything was quiet again.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This was the eleventh earthquake that year, in a place that had never recorded a single one previously.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">What was happening? Susie Beiersdorfer, a geologist at Youngstown State University, who was making a poster for an anti-fracking protest when the quake hit, thought she knew the answer.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Three months and another earthquake later, when the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) came out with its preliminary report, Beiersdorfer&rsquo;s suspicions were confirmed.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The recent spate of seismicity in Youngstown had all occurred around the Northstar 1 Class II deep injection well, located between the Mahoning River and Interstate 680, about a mile northwest of the city center.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In operation since December the previous year, it had been used for the disposal of production waste -&nbsp;flowback and brine -&nbsp;coming from shale gas development in neighboring Pennsylvania.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Susie Beiersdorfer standing in front of Northstar 1 deep injection well in Youngstown, Ohio. (Image: Dimiter Kenarov)\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/DPK_4513.JPG\\\" style=\\\"width: 918px; \\\" /></p><p style=\\\"\\\">As the brine was pumped down under high pressure, almost 10,000 feet underground, in basement Precambrian rock billions of years old, it lubricated naturally occurring geological faults, which slipped and induced earthquakes, ranging from 2.1 to the largest one (4.0) on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A similar injection well (one of currently 192 in Ohio) contributed to a 4.5 magnitude quake in Ashtabula, in the northernmost part of the state, in January 2001, but that had been seen at the time as an isolated event.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now, with the shale gas boom in full swing and the rising demand for the so-called Class II deep injection wells -&nbsp;the standard industry practice for disposal of oil and gas waste in porous rock formations thousands of feet underground -&nbsp;earthquakes were becoming more common.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It was a real wake-up call for a lot of people in Youngstown. It shook them up, literally, and became a catalyst for the movement against shale gas development and waste disposal,&rdquo; Beiersdorfer, one of the chief organizers of that movement, tells me, as we walk around the Northstar 1 injection well.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It was here that seven activists had been arrested in November 2011 during a protest, having demanded the closure of the well a month before the largest earthquake hit.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The site has since been shut down by order of ODNR. Fourteen storage tanks remain locked behind a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire, two oversize tires from a loader blocking road access.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Susie Beiersdorfer knows about fossil fuels.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the late 1910s or early 1920s her grand-father moved from West Virginia to California, where he worked on oil rigs and later started his own oil-tool service company, which her father eventually inherited in the 1950s.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It sold drilling bits and core barrels to the oil and gas industry, as well as equipment for well stimulation, the early name of hydraulic fracturing.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The family lived in a house on a bluff overlooking the Kern River Oil Field near Bakersfield, in the San Joaquin Valley, one of the oldest and largest oil fields in the United States.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">As a kid, she would ride in the back of her father&rsquo;s pickup, as he made his daily deliveries to drillers, and later helped him with the accounting side of the business.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Instead of fairies and giants, her childhood world was populated by derricks and pumpjacks pasturing among the rocky dreamscapes of California.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She was planning on becoming a petroleum engineer like her father, but eventually her love of rocks prevailed.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She took a degree in geology and started a job as a mud logger, examining and keeping track of the geological strata during oil and gas drilling, living in trailers next to drilling sites.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Her husband, Raymond Beiersdorfer, also a geologist, worked in oil exploration for Gulf Oil in the Bakersfield region.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After short stays in Australia and Canada, the two of them settled in Ohio in 1993, where he joined the department of Geological and Environmental Sciences at Youngstown State University.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Wandering around Susie and Raymond Beiersdorfer&rsquo;s home, a beautiful three-story brick house on a quiet street in central Youngstown, it is impossible not to be struck by their passion for geology -&nbsp;science books are everywhere.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Even the first names of the twin daughters -&nbsp;Crystal and Rochelle (French for &ldquo;little rock&rdquo;) -&nbsp;carry the stamp of their parents&rsquo; preoccupation.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For a few years in the late 1990s, Raymond used to spend his summers as a researcher at NASA&rsquo;s Johnson Space Center, where he worked on developing synthetic soils for growing crops in space, until funding for the project was canceled.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Between semesters, he takes his university students on geology trips to China.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now the family&rsquo;s love of rocks has been transformed into a battle against hydraulic fracturing and deep injection wells.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Having seen their fair share of oil and gas extraction, with the associated environmental risks, the Beiersdorfers have become fossil-fuel apostates.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Large placards, pitched in the lawn in front of their house, clearly announce the views of the owners: Don&rsquo;t Frack Our Water and We All Live Downstream.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Studies on the dangers of fracking lie scattered around the house. A room above the garage serves as Susie&rsquo;s office and a workroom for making fliers and protest posters.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Beiersdorfer has become the main engine behind the anti-fracking movement in Youngstown, the child of the oil world waging a battle against her roots.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Fifty-four years old, with silky white hair and a pale, earnest face, wearing a pair of peace-sign earrings and photochromic glasses, she has the traces of California&rsquo;s 1960s imprinted all over her, yet she is firmly grounded in the twenty-first century.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Now an assistant professor at Youngstown State University, she has been teaching online classes for the past six years, introducing students to the basics of geology.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I feel that when people learn more about the geology of the Earth, they can appreciate it more and become better stewards,&rdquo; she tells me as we sit in her kitchen, what she and her husband like to call &ldquo;the frack-free zone.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Steel legacy</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the first half of the twentieth century, Youngstown, nestled in Ohio&rsquo;s Mahoning Valley, was one of the three largest steel manufacturers in the nation with dozens of foundries, their fat smokestacks belching black plumes into a leaden sky.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">People here used to joke that the day you didn&rsquo;t have to sweep soot off your porch was the day that spelled trouble.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">That day came on 19 September&nbsp;1977, locally known as Black Monday, when 4,100 steel workers at the Campbell plant of Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube, the city&rsquo;s biggest employer at the time, were laid off.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The big steel mills had been struggling for years, but by the early 1980s they began shutting down, one by one, as automation and cheap imports drove the industry to faraway parts of the world.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Since then, more than 50,000 people in the steel and related industries in the greater Youngstown area have lost their jobs, and the city&rsquo;s population has shrunk from 139,000 in 1970 to less than 67,000 today.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Thousands of vacant properties and lots stand silent witnesses to a human tragedy.

Brownfields and hollowed shells of factories litter the landscape.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Boarded-up houses, covered with graffiti, blight the neighborhoods. Meth addicts and drunks roam the streets.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The heavy soot has disappeared from the air, but the streams and soil in the area are still full of industrial poisons and heavy metals.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Youngstown has a long history of industry coming here, exploiting the resources, polluting the land and then leaving, without leaving any structure behind for citizens who live here,&rdquo; she says, as we cross the bridge over the muddy current of the Mahoning River, where no one dares to swim.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Despite the environmental dangers, many residents in Youngstown feel that the shale gas industry could revitalize the region and provide much-needed jobs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On the bank of the Mahoning River, some 2,000 feet from the Northstar 1 injection well, there is already proof: A new 650 million USD steel mill, employing 350 workers, was recently built by the French company Vallourec&mdash;the first big manufacturer to open doors in the city since the economic collapse three decades ago.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The mill makes steel pipes for the shale gas wells in Pennsylvania and for the budding extraction in Ohio&rsquo;s Utica Shale, another giant gas field under Youngstown and eastern Ohio.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the three counties surrounding the city -&nbsp;Mahoning, Trumbull&nbsp;and Columbiana -&nbsp;there are already seventy-nine drilled or permitted shale gas wells. Pickup trucks -&nbsp;the main vehicle of choice for itinerant drillers -&nbsp;fill the parking lots in front of local motels.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&#39;Welcome Oil &amp; Gas Industry&#39; reads a sign in front of a striptease club.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Beiersdorfer admits that shale gas could provide much-needed employment for the city, but she fears it may prove another short-lived dream, leaving the environment, just recovering from the sad legacy of the steel industry, even more devastated than before.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In Pennsylvania, a mere four years into the gas boom, companies have already started to leave, scared off by overproduction and the depressed gas prices on the market.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;There is a lot of hype about the shale gas industry bringing the economy around,&rdquo; she says.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;A lot of people like to say that by putting a watch on the industry we are killing any hope for prosperity in the area. But while there may be a job increase, those are not permanent jobs. We need a sustainable industry, something like the manufacturing of solar panels and wind turbines. We need to get off the fossil-fuel hamster wheel. Shale gas, to me, is a classic boom-and-bust.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After more than two years of research into hydraulic fracturing and injection wells, she has become fully convinced of the dangers of both to groundwater supplies.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At the end of November 2011, after the first series of earthquakes, she and a couple of other Youngstown residents started a movement against shale gas production and waste disposal in the city limits.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After the New Year&rsquo;s Eve quake, they created Frackfree Mahoning Valley. The group, a core of about thirty activists, has since organized dozens of protests, educational events, and community forums, and has set up websites as a counterweight to the pervasive public-\\u200brelations campaigns funded by gas companies.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Most of the protests have been small, usually a few dozen people. (After the big earthquake, a meeting organized by the Youngstown City Council attracted more than 500 concerned residents, including their group.) Using social media, they have coordinated with organizations from Ohio, Pennsylvania&nbsp;and New York.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of money and lobbyism on the industry side, but we are just a group of citizens, putting in our own time and money. Our main goal is to try to educate people and point them to resources,&rdquo; Beiersdorfer tells me.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not na&iuml;ve enough to think we&rsquo;re going to wean ourselves off of petroleum products right now. So many people drive cars, heat their homes with natural gas. Everybody&rsquo;s got plastic around them. We don&rsquo;t claim to be creating any sort of big change, but I think that by shining a light on the industry, they would have to be a bit more cautious than they&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For one meeting between industry and local legislators, the group printed oversize mockup checks with the amount of campaign contributions that members of the US Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources had received from oil and gas companies. 340,684 USD was one amount; 696,940 USD read another.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When the Youngstown City Council voted to allow officials to lease city land for shale gas extraction -&nbsp;including parks and golf courses -&nbsp;Beiersdorfer and her group started a petition to put on the ballot a community-based ban on hydraulic fracturing within city limits, similar to a measure that Pittsburgh and a few dozen other places across the country had passed.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It is unacceptable that local residents can&rsquo;t say where companies can drill for oil and gas,&rdquo; she tells me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only about fracking, but about our community. It seems that now local people have fewer rights than corporations.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The next day, brisk and cloudy, Beiersdorfer and I drive to Meander Creek Reservoir.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">About seven miles west of Youngstown, it supplies drinking water to more than 220,000 people. No boating or swimming or fishing is allowed.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Yet, at the end of 2012, a gas company, Consol Energy, started drilling a shale gas well in the protection area of the reservoir, some 150 feet from a creek that empties directly into the main body of water.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On our drive, billboards parade their two-dimensional worlds. &#39;The Answer to Foreign Oil: American Natural Gas&#39;, an ad for Chesapeake Energy boldly proclaims. &#39;Keep Our Community Safe &amp; Healthy&#39;. &#39;Stop Fracking!&#39; another billboard, sponsored by an environmental group, counters. Like in the rest of the world, the war over shale gas rages full force here, dividing people, or uniting them in strange and unlikely alliances.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Politicians, businesspeople, economists, geologists, engineers, environmentalists, movie stars, journalists, and citizens of all stripes have all joined in the fray, each with his or her own view on the subject.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It has turned into a battle of visions, of clashing ideologies, over the global future of energy, water use, and the climate risks of continued dependence on fossil fuels.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Soon, the bleak strip malls and blighted neighborhoods of Youngstown give way to the mixed woods of Meander Creek Reservoir, beech and pine, maple and birch.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">We pass over a bridge, an endless expanse reflecting the orange afternoon light streaming through the clouds. It feels almost surreal, moving so imperceptibly from a human landscape of post-industrial rubble into the wild growth of nature.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After a few minutes of driving through fields and forested country roads, we reach a concrete lot, pickups and people hurrying around. A tall drilling rig, its latticework painted yellow and white, rises right in the middle. It is the totem pole of the underworld.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Vama Veche, Romania</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Are you here for the protest against shale&thinsp;gas?&rdquo; the middle-aged woman at the window counter on the Romanian border asks me.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Dressed in a navy-blue blazer, with henna-reddish hair, sitting behind a bulky desktop computer, she looks like the perfect bureaucrat.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I nod my head.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Her stern face softens into a wide, friendly smile.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I am one of the organizers of the movement against shale gas,&rdquo; she says. Then she places her handbag on the desk and proceeds to take out a Romanian tricolor ribbon and a campaign button that says &#39;No to Shale Gas&#39;&nbsp;in Bulgarian.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be wearing these tomorrow,&rdquo; she tells me, looking me straight in the eye.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It is a little past midnight on May 1, 2012, and I have just driven up the western coast of the Black Sea, crossing from Bulgaria into Romania.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A friend of mine had told me about an anti-fracking protest planned in the tiny seaside village of Vama Veche, about three miles from the border. I decided to see it for myself.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be collecting signatures at the large army tent on the beach. You can&rsquo;t miss it,&rdquo; she says and hands me a receipt for the road toll. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you there tomorrow.&quot;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Vama Veche (which in Romanian means &#39;old customs point&#39;), in the Dobrogea region of southeast Romania, was the capital of Romanian counterculture during the brutal communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Intellectuals and hippies would come here to escape -&nbsp;in their imaginations, at least -&nbsp;the country&rsquo;s oppressive political regime, renting rooms from peasants and fishermen, pitching tents on the famous nude beach.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After Ceausescu and his wife had been shot by a firing squad during the Romanian revolution of 1989, Vama Veche maintained its free spirit, escaping the atrocious residential developments that sprung up along other parts of the Black Sea coast.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Romania has no Woodstock, but it has Vama Veche.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When I enter the village, a party is already in full swing. The main street, leading down to the sandy beach, is packed with young people -&nbsp;rockers, punks, hippies, goths, metal-heads, bohemians. A gathering of prodigals.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The smell of cheap alcohol and pot wafts in the breeze, bars and caf&eacute;s playing a cacophonic mashup of songs.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A skull-and-bones flag flies over the wooden shed of La Pirati, a drinking hole with tricked-out choppers parked outside. Intoxicated teenagers wait in tangled lines in front of brightly lit-up gyro joints.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">One bakery is open for business at this late hour, selling&nbsp;k&uuml;rtoskal&aacute;cs, Hungarian cinnamon pastries sprinkled with powdered sugar. There is something for everybody here.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Down on the beach, where the Black Sea laps at the cold sand, dozens of bonfires are burning, people sitting around them, wrapped in woolen blankets, swigging beer and playing guitars.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Away from the crowds, couples are making out, double silhouettes against the shiny backdrop of crimpled, moon-lit water.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On the far end of the beach, some two hundred people dance around a wooden mockup of a derrick, a dozen hand-held flares illuminating the night in eerie crimson. It looks like a tribal ritual.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Rage Against the Machine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guerilla Radio&rdquo; is blasting from powerful speakers. The large circle sways to the rhythm, back and forth, left and right, banners and placards raised above the sea of bobbing heads.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&#39;It is our own nature and the decision is ours.&#39;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&#39;We are 60 per cent&nbsp;water and don&rsquo;t want to be poisoned.&#39;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&#39;Romania does not want Chevron.&#39;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Then somebody picks up a chant in English.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Get the fuck out, Chevron! Get the fuck out, Chevron! Get the fuck out, Chevron!&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After a few minutes of commotion, the circle slowly reconfigures itself into a line. About fifty of the most dedicated protestors begin marching down the beach and then up the main street. The crowds part in front of them.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Get the fuck out, Chevron! Get the fuck out, Chevron! Get the fuck out, Chevron!&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">An anti-fracking rally on the Black Sea beach at one in the morning! A few onlookers, not knowing what is happening but dimly recognizing the expletives, drunkenly take up the chant.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A television crew, tipped off about the event, follows the protestors, cameras rolling.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Tomorrow, Romania will know about this.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Vama Veche has long been a getaway for \\u201cfree spirits\\u201d and families alike.

A big colorful banner with the words &#39;Lasati Vama Verde&#39; (Leave Vama Green)&nbsp;has been affixed over the entrance.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Painted on square pieces of Styrofoam are various other slogans: &#39;Stop the Exploitation of Shale Gas&#39;; &#39;Save the Sea&#39;; &#39;Sign the Petition&#39;. Anti-fracking leaflets and carefully catalogued petition sheets, alphabetized by the signatory&rsquo;s place of residence, have been laid out on a small wooden table.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Cruceanu has been transformed.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Gone is the state worker&rsquo;s navy-blue blazer. Instead she wears motley-striped shalwar pants and a purple shirt with a generous neckline, bulky sunglasses, and a flower-patterned scarf draped over her head to keep the blistering sun away.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">As she vowed the previous night, she has the Romanian tricolor ribbon and the Bulgarian button &#39;No to shale gas&#39; pinned to her bosom.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It was Bulgarian activists who had first supplied her with information and materials on the dangers of fracking.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"In the seaside village of Vama Veche, Romania, Rodica Cruceanu collects signatures to push for a parliamentary commission to investigate the environmental impact of fracking. (Image: Dimiter Kenarov)\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/DSCN0985.JPG\\\" style=\\\"width: 918px; \\\" /></p><p style=\\\"\\\">Until the spring of 2012, when the national media broke the news that Chevron had won several gas concessions in Romania, Cruceanu did not know much about the issue.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She was forty-three years old, a government worker sitting behind a counter at the Vama Veche customs, dealing with the road toll for vehicles entering Romania.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She had a degree in economics and had previously worked in the hotel and restaurant business.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She had never in her life taken part in any environmental campaigns, except once, when she helped with the collection of signatures for protection of endangered Black Sea dolphins.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She had moved to Vama Veche twenty years before to enjoy a quiet and leisurely life by the seaside. Nothing was further away from her mind than hydraulic fracturing.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Then she saw the film &#39;Gasland&#39; and was horrified. Using Facebook, she got in touch with activists, who gave her additional resources.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Knowing some English from her stint in the tourism industry, she read studies about the negative effects of shale gas on communities in the United States, about the cases of groundwater contamination, the chemicals injected deep underground, the difficulty of dealing with the flowback and brine, the emissions coming from wells and compressor stations.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I said to myself, &lsquo;Wait a minute! This here is my country, my home, the place where I&rsquo;m raising my child,&rsquo;&rdquo; she tells me when she manages to take off a minute from campaigning.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t fight, who will? Someone has to care for this Earth, if we are to survive. We shouldn&rsquo;t repeat the same mistakes that others have done.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Together with her friend Paul Iurea, a local investigative journalist, Cruceanu set up a campaign against fracking. They started distributing leaflets to their neighbors, but the response was tepid.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Some would say that it was good business. Others would just not listen, too preoccupied with their lives. &#39;We will all have to die from something someday&#39;, the cynics responded.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Despite such indifference, she kept on going. Soon, her community of Facebook friends confronting similar issues around the world was closer to her than her own neighbors. She felt she was part of something global, much bigger than herself.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Water is our life&nbsp;and we can&rsquo;t afford to destroy it. It&rsquo;s more important to us than a few jobs,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We can easily find another energy source, but we can&rsquo;t find more water. I&rsquo;m fighting for my child and for all the children whose parents are not realizing what is happening.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The turnout at the army tent is remarkable. Scores of vacationers from all over Romania, most of them in their twenties and thirties, flock to the table to sign the petition.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Men in swimming trunks; women in flimsy bikinis. Punks, rockers, metal-heads. A few elderly couples. Cruceanu and her journalist friend Iurea, a bald-headed man in an embroidered cotton tunic, the indispensable tricolor ribbon and anti-fracking button pinned on his breast, can hardly keep up with the demand.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A few activists from other places in the county have come to help them, but even they are overwhelmed. By the end of the campaign drive at Vama Veche, more than 10,000 people sign the petition -&nbsp;not enough to have it reviewed by parliament, but impressive nonetheless.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I feel truly happy today,&rdquo; Cruceanu says to me with a huge grin, while handing out leaflets and mineral water to passersby. &ldquo;The reaction from people is wonderful. Some activists like to fight fracking with dancing and songs. But we can only really change our laws through official petitions.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At that moment her cell phone rings -&nbsp;&#39;The House of the Rising Sun&#39;&nbsp;by The Animals -&nbsp;and she picks up. It is her teenage daughter.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I walk away from the tent, down toward the sea. The fine sand feels hot, almost searing under my bare feet. Beachgoers have spread out colorful beach towels, each one a little pad of comfort.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When I step into the surf, water and foam crash against me, a slight undertow tugging me in.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Shells and pebbles lie scattered under the surface, soon to be crushed into sand. Millions of years ago, single-cell creatures lived and died in primordial oceans, their remains buried at the bottom, turning slowly into gas.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Millions of years from now, nobody will remember us.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Reporting for this article was funded by the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://pulitzercenter.org/\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.shalereporter.com/\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Calkins Media</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://birn.eu.com/en/page/home\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The Balkan Investigative Reporting Network</a>.</p>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"41a37f8f-934d-4a92-8bbe-cfd8149a13e9\"}]"}, "pk": 1152, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

And he openly spoke with admiration of the Legion of the Archangel Michael, the fascist movement also known as The Iron Guard, which played a major role in Romania's political and social life from the 1920s to the 1940s.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The current Republic of Moldova, except for the area known as Transnistria, had been part of Romania for most of that period.<b style=\\\"\\\"> </b></span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">It was briefly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, before German-led forces swept through Romania to the Ukraine in 1941.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The 'Legionnaires' were ultra-nationalist and strongly anti-Jewish. They promoted Orthodox Christianity as a vital national value. They differed in their religious fervor from other fascist movements in Europe&nbsp;</span>and rejected capitalism as overly materialistic.</p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The Legion numbered many priests among its ranks and some of the ideas promoted by Cibric's organization are similar to this fascist movement, including the anti-Jewish sentiment and the rejection of capitalism and 'Western' values such as tolerance toward sexual and religious minorities.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">\\\"Tolerance means to fail to resist to evil and harm,\\\" father Cibric says. \\\"In medical terms, tolerance means not fighting back.\\\" </span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">All those who use this term are retarded, sick and ignorant, he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">\\\"The Devil laughs at the entire mankind: 'tolerance, tolerance.' That is -&nbsp;'Don't fight back.'\\\"</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The Devil is a constant presence in Cibric's discourse. The &lsquo;evil one&rsquo; can be found in microchips, Government-issued ID numbers, books explaining sexual differences to children, taxation, bankers, vaccines, the promotion of gay rights, liberal plays such as 'The Vagina Monologues' and films like 'The Da Vinci Code.'&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The 'Matrona' organization has protested against all of these. Here is a timeline presenting the most important actions in the life of the group:</span></p><p class=\\\"p1 afterTimeline\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">And, with the Devil being so close, the apocalypse cannot be far away.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">\\\"It's already passed through our door,\\\" Cibric says. The signs are everywhere. There is a global plot, orchestrated by Jews, who run everything now, to weaken and corrupt the human race so that when the time comes we won't be able to call for God and save ourselves. </span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">You have to be stupid not to see this, according to the priest.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">At first glance, there is favorable terrain for his ideas to spread. In the little republic jammed between Romania and Ukraine, over 90 per cent of citizens declare themselves Christian Orthodox.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">This, in a country where religious people had been persecuted during the Soviet and Nazi periods. </span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">When I first visited Chisinau, the capital, in the 1990s, many churches were still abandoned and had blackened walls.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"The Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ's Nativity, built in the 1830s, stands next to Chisinau's main square.

It has played a major role in the signing of the association treaty between the EU and Moldova, and Romania's president Traian Basescu has called for the unification of the two countries to become a national priority<b style=\\\"\\\">.</b></span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">To some extent, this is a battle between the old and the new. This is symbolically apparent when it comes to the religious calendar. The Bishopric of Moldova, like its parent organization, the Russian Orthodox Church, follows the Old Style, where Christmas falls on 7 January.</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The Bishopric of Bessarabia is also an Old Style church, although the rest of the Romanian Orthodox Church celebrates Christmas on 25 December.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">But beyond such formal differences, advocates for closer ties with the West argue that the European Union means social and economic progress, while some of those who are against point out that Europe equals moral and economic distress. </span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">There is a moral crisis in the European Union, they argue, and capitalism is failing - so people should stick to their tradition.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">These are also some of the arguments raised by father Cibric. His association, 'The Blessed Mother Matrona', fights against some of the basic values of Western society. </span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">According to its raison d'etre, the association is &lsquo;against globalization, that is, for defending the faith and the people, rejecting the laws imposed on the country by the global ruling system.&rsquo; </span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The organization &lsquo;fights for the right to live without the personal ID number, which is compulsory for every person.&rsquo; It also pledges to &lsquo;reveal and fight against heretic currents and deeds.&rsquo;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">If this sounds familiar, it is because we have become accustomed to identify such attitudes with Islamic fundamentalism, which labels modern Western values as heresy.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The West is falling, Cibric tells me. He points out that people in France are suffering from hunger, and that the USA is on the brink of civil war - and to prove it he shows me filmed interviews with conspiracy theorists and clips showing the US military readying millions of coffins. </span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">He watches such videos on YouTube. He doesn't understand English, but the clips are dubbed or subtitled in Russian.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1 afterCibric\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Today you can use technology like the Internet to be informed about what's really happening in the world, Cibric says.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">I point out to him that he also says technology is the Devil's tool, but he does not think this is a contradiction.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">He argues that the Jews are running the world, but at the same time complains about the growing influence of Islam. According to Cibric, countries like France and the Netherlands have not only given up on their Christianity, but are becoming Muslim territories.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">And it's not only happening in the rotten West - all the Asians from the former Soviet Union have now moved to Moscow and Muslims are practically running the show in the Russian capital, he says.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">His organization has opposed the legalization of the Islamic League in Moldova. Muslims should never be allowed to build mosques in a Christian country, Cibric says.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">In spite of the apparent popularity of Orthodox Christianity, 'Matrona' represents a minor group in the Republic of Moldova, says Petre Guran.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">In countries like Moldova, Romania, and others in this region of Eastern Europe, where 80 to 90 per cent or more of the population declare themselves Christian Orthodox, those who&nbsp;go to church regularly are in much lower numbers, according to Guran.</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">He estimates that only ten to 20 per cent of Orthodox Christians practice their faith conscientiously. From those practicing Christians, only about ten to 20 per cent are radicals, Guran adds. This means very few.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">However in Moldova, 'Matrona' is a visible and sometimes effective group. </span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Cibric and his followers managed to force a Chisinau theatre to stop a staging of 'The Vagina Monologues,'<b style=\\\"\\\"> </b>which the organization labels immoral and anti-Christian.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">They delayed the broadcast of a film on gay rights on public television, claiming it promoted immoral behavior</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">They&nbsp;disrupted a celebration of Hanukkah because it thought it was inappropriate for the small Jewish community to install a menorah in the Great National Assembly Square, the heart of an Orthodox country.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">On the other hand, Chisinau used to be largely a Jewish town. Toward the end of the 19th century, about half of the city&rsquo;s population was Jewish. According to estimates from the Moldovan embassy in Israel, there are now only 20-25,000 Jews living in Moldova.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Petre Guran of the Institute for South-East European Studies says the 'Matrona' phenomenon is not exclusive to the Republic of Moldova. Similar groups are present in all the Orthodox Christian countries.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">It is \\\"a form of religious radicalism combined with politics, which openly assumes a political message,\\\" says Guran. In this case, he adds, we can see the Orthodox values being systematically opposed to Western values.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Intellectually, these people are still living in the years right after 1204, Guran says, referring to the&nbsp;sacking of the Christian Orthodox city of Constantinople by Western European Crusaders, following the East-West Schism of 1054, when Christianity separated into&nbsp;what&nbsp;became the Catholic and the Orthodox churches.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">According to Guran, there is a faction of the Orthodox Church that is still under the emotional shock of a Christian power conquering and spoiling another Christian power. </span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">This is the oldest layer in the historic opposition to the West, Guran says. Over this layer, he explains, there are various other layers and political interests. In some cases, Orthodoxy becomes a mark of ethnic and national identity, and &lsquo;the opposition between Orthodoxy and Western Christianity is used as a barrier in the way of any form of political union, or at least of political dialog.&rsquo;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">There have been voices in Moldova that have accused the 'Blessed Mother Matrona' organization of serving the interests of the communist party, which dominated Moldovan politics until 2009, although father Cibric and his followers have criticized all the political groups, including the communists.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Cibric has also been a critic of the leaders of his own church.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">\\\"The Patriarchs are cowards,\\\" he tells me, referring to the heads of the Russian and Romanian Orthodox churches. \\\"They are not real fathers (of their churches), as a father should defend his family.\\\"</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Cibric speaks against 'ecumenism' --the current that attempts to reunite the world's Christian churches -- just as he speaks against globalization. Both the Russian and the Romanian churches promote ecumenism, and this is pure heresy, he says. Instead, they should stand for the values of the true faith. Which he does, by opposing the modern values of the European Union.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">According to a group of clerics within his church, he is doing it the wrong way, though. In October 2010, professors and priests from several churches affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church in Moldova signed a note that describes Cibric's organization as \\\"aggressive, intolerant and prone to hooliganism.\\\" His actions are against the true spirit of Christianity, the note argued.</span></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Cibric answers that one should fight as long as he can, with the weapons that he has.

Most of Moldova's Orthodox Christians have been traditionally observing the 'Old Style' (or the Julian calendar) rather than the 'New Style' (or the Gregorian calendar, observed by most Christian churches around the world), and this is how the Christmas date has become a subject of national debate.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For years, Dorin Chirtoaca, the liberal mayor of Chisinau, has been promoting closer ties with Romania and the European Union, as well as making 25 December&nbsp;the official Christmas Day in Moldova.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2007, he was battling the communist government in power at the time for the right to install and light up the official Christmas tree of the city before the 'New Style' Christmas.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Christmas lights in Chisinau go up every year at the start of December.

The liberals have been saying that such a decision would be a step toward the country's European integration.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However, celebrating Christmas on December 25 is more of a political -&nbsp;and personal -&nbsp;affair rather than a church-going event.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Although the Romanian church observes the 'New Style,' its Moldovan bishopric is defined as an 'Old Style' church. Christians in Moldova have traditionally observed the Julian calendar, and no church seems to be willing to alienate parishioners by changing their holidays.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Many young Moldovans now celebrate Christmas with friends on 25 December&nbsp;and with their parents on 7 January.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"What's tragic here is not that we celebrate Christmas on two different dates,\\\"&nbsp;says Tatiana Etco, a Chisinau-based journalist.\\\"But&nbsp;that we've kind of lost the holiday spirit.\\\"&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She says the members of her family only say 'Merry Christmas' to each other, but are no longer aware of the significance of the holiday.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"We don't know what it means,\\\" she adds. \\\"It's been&nbsp;lost in all the conflicts between the churches.\\\"&nbsp;</p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><span style=\\\"\\\">Alex Ulmanu is reporting on religion as a fellow with the <a href=\\\"http://internationalreportingproject.org\\\" style=\\\"\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">International Reporting Project (IRP)</a>.</span></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"e3279ae2-3b19-4710-8736-0915bcd7a7c7\"}]"}, "pk": 1157, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

He was convicted twice for heroin possession.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">His energy group Regal Petroleum was fined 600,000 GBP after it plummeted 88 per cent on the London stock market in 2009, following the release of false information about an oil discovery in the Aegean Sea between 2003 and 2005.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The businessman resigned from Gabriel Resources in 2002 and moved on to developing diamond mines in Sierra Leone.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Today, according to the Romanian media, Frank Timis is the wealthiest living Romanian, due to his extensive mining businesses in Africa - and is worth around two billion Euro.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">2005: &ldquo;Timis is a dirty word&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2005, the strong opposition to the mining project saw Gabriel Resources&nbsp;stepping up its lobbying presence in Romania.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The new CEO of the company, Alan Hill, told an audience at Bucharest&prime;s Hilton Hotel in October that year that &ldquo;Frank Timis is a dirty word&rdquo;, indicating an end to the involvement of the controversial businessman.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Since Timis&rsquo;s departure, the company has undergone several makeovers, with the addition of high-profile political players to the board.&nbsp;<br style=\\\"\\\" />Former Canadian Ambassador to Romania, Raphael Girard, was brought in as director from 2005 to 2010.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ex-Chancellor of Austria and member of the Austrian delegation to the parliamentary meeting of the Council of Europe in 1991 and chairman of the social committee of the Council of Europe from 1995 to 1998, Alfred Gusenbauer, currently works as an independent&nbsp;director.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Girard was not shy of using his political connections in Bucharest, which he forged during his time as ambassador, when the company&nbsp;needed to advance the project.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Internal correspondence released by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) under Freedom of Information (FOI) show that the former diplomat believed he had inroads with the Romanian President Traian Basescu.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When discussing about organizing top level meetings with Romanian politicians, Girard said: &ldquo;I did have some considerable contact with [the] then Mayor [of Bucharest]&nbsp;Basescu including giving him top billing at the Canada Day exercises in 2001 when his standing with the Central Government was bad and getting rapidly worse.&rdquo; (June 6, 2005).</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However, Girard also appears to be have been aware of the difficulties faced by President Basescu in meeting company representatives.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On a later occasion in 2006, Girard adds: &ldquo;the politics of Rosia Montana are still not too auspicious for a president to be seen receiving someone from the company&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But he intended to pursue the president as &ldquo;in the not too distant past [Basescu] has remarked to mutual friends that he remembers me with some degree of warm feeling&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The Romanian Presidency has denied any involvement in preferential discussions with Girard.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">2006: Surreal turn</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In October 2006, UK actress and left-wing activist Vanessa Redgrave grabbed local headlines by condemning the mining project.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She showed solidarity with the protestors by purchasing a strip of land where the mine is planned, urging others to do the same. The gesture was meant to obstruct any mining company wishing to purchase people&prime;s property.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">That October, Redgrave was guest of honor at the Bucharest Hallowe&#39;en Ball, which raised money for local NGO Ovidiu Rom&prime;s child education&nbsp;programmes.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For charity, the NGO auctioned a dance with Redgrave.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The bidding started at a feeble 500 Euro, but the Blow Up-actress, stated: &ldquo;I will not dance for less than 10,000 Euro.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At the event, Gabriel Resources&prime; then corporate affairs manager, Irishman John Ashton, pitched in 10,500 Euro for the dance.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The bidding stopped.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">While waltzing with the British actress, Ashton tried to convince her to come to Rosia Montana, telling the Socialist activist and 60s icon how the local miners&prime; unions are supportive of the project and how his company will take care of the people and heritage.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Redgrave has still never visited the site.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Since then, star of Splash! and Kill Bill, Daryl Hannah, has&nbsp;bought a piece of land.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><br style=\\\"\\\" />&nbsp;<br style=\\\"\\\" />2007: Canadian state rep offers&nbsp;Gabriel PR advice</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The Canadian Government also supported Gabriel&rsquo;s project. Diplomats and the new ambassador following Girard&rsquo;s departure,&nbsp;Marta Moszenska, listened to the company&rsquo;s concerns and contributed to the company&rsquo;s efforts to maintain a positive image.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A DFAIT&nbsp;release shows that Bucharest-based diplomat Francois Lasalle gave RMGC public relations advice on at least one occasion.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In April 2007, RMGC invited then Ambassador&nbsp;Moszenska&nbsp;to an event and offered security. Lasalle made it clear protection was not necessary, but advised the company to use this as a PR opportunity.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;If you feel that specific security arrangements are required (I do not), I would strongly advise you that you go through local authorities, perhaps mentioning to them that the presence of a few police officers would be useful, and it would make it &lsquo;official&rsquo;, without any accusations later that the company brought &lsquo;goons&rsquo; or other type of private security staff... Again, this is strictly a PR concern on my part, not a security one!&rdquo;<br style=\\\"\\\" />&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">2007: Controversial &lsquo;Corporate social responsibility&rsquo; award</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The company&rsquo;s PR leverage stretched beyond Romania. Gabriel hired Austrian corporate social responsibility (CSR) adviser Martin Neureiter briefly in 2006. But Neureiter&rsquo;s link to the company did not end with his brief contract.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2007 Gabriel Resources CEO, Alan Hill, received the ICON VIENNA Corporate Social Responsibility award from the Austrian parliament. It was soon revealed Neureiter sat on the jury panel and voted for Hill to win the award.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Once Neureiter&rsquo;s involvement was noted, the Hungarian Foreign Affairs Ministry and Greenpeace Austria asked for the prize to be withdrawn. Neureiter wrote to Greenpeace Austria, explaining he was able to support Gabriel in good faith, as he knew Hill&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">President of the Austrian Parliament, Barbara Prammer, also stepped in and said the awarding of the prize to Gabriel&rsquo;s CEO reflected negatively on its value.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Prammer added that the &ldquo;prize nominator and jury member is found to be in conflict of interest due to professional involvement with Gabriel Resources.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After the event, the president of the Austrian National Council decided in April 2007 that &ldquo;in the future, no CSR award ceremony can be held at the Austrian Parliament,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;more efforts should be made to avoid the involvement of the lobbyists in shaping CSR-projects&rdquo;.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile in Bucharest, Lasalle was rallying his embassy colleagues in Budapest and Vienna to support Hill&rsquo;s award by talking with Austrian parliament members, according to DFAIT&rsquo;s releases.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The award was not withdrawn.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Neureiter explained in his&nbsp;right to reply feedback, &ldquo;the award was never revoked as ... it was seen that the process was ok and therefore no reason was seen to change the vote of the jury. The management of the time dealt with this project in the utmost responsible manner regarding exactly the possible impacts on society and environment.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">2010: ex-White House Counsel link</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Gabriel Resources hired John Schmitz, former White House Deputy Counsel to President George Bush Snr, in 2010.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He worked in Brussels and Germany to promote the company&rsquo;s environmental image.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the past, Schmitz had worked alongside the then US Ambassador to Romania, Mark Gitenstein, for the lobbying firm Mayer Brown LLP. Gitenstein ended his diplomatic mandate to Romania in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Former US Ambassador to the European Union, Stuart Eizenstat, who has also lobbied for Gabriel Resources&rsquo;s gold mine development in Romania, worked in the American public service under three administrations, including Clinton.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In his current role within Covington &amp; Burling LLP, he represents the interests of various U.S. and foreign corporations.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Covington &amp; Burling has lobbied for Gabriel in 2009 and 2013, with Eizenstat leading the talks. Washington-based Dutko Worldwide LLC (now Dutko Grayling) has also represented the mining company&rsquo;s interests in the US in 2009.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Additionally, the US lobbyist registrations attest that Gabriel Resources&rsquo;s presence in the American corridors of power, lobbying on the &ldquo;development of a gold mine in Romania&rdquo; in 2009, 2010 and&nbsp;2012.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Asked whether he was requested to advocate to the Romanian government on behalf of Gabriel Resources, ex-US Ambassador&nbsp;Gitenstein confirmed the contact with the company&rsquo;s lobbyists by pointing out that &ldquo;neither I nor, to my knowledge, anyone at the US embassy advocate to the Romanian government on behalf of Rosia Montana or those interested in developing Rosia Montana.

The restaurant manager is eyeing him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A little fearful, he searches in his white pouch.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After several seconds, he says he does not have &lsquo;Chanel Five&rsquo; but can offer me perfumes from Christian Dior and Paco Rabanne for about 25 Euro.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t choose the brands from the place I get them from,&rdquo; he says, somewhat disappointed in himself. &ldquo;I just pick them up from a pile.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This hawker is the final link in a chain that starts in China, stops-over in Dubai and ends up on the shores of the European Union.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He buys his merchandise from a middleman, who, in his turn, purchases the perfumes from a distributor, who brings the products into Romania through the Black Sea port of Constanta.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This port plays host to the passage of thousands of containers every day, yet no more than a few dozen are subject to inspection by customs and border police.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But none of these brands are real.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Counterfeit deluge</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">An intense siren sounds as haulage equipment moves a 20-ton container from a storage platform to the back of a lorry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Amid the heavy vehicles and the noises of the cranes swarm Border control officers. Some are dressed as civilians and others carry guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The harsh sea breeze, alongside the whirr of lorry engines and the rumbling of the loading machinery, creates the atmosphere of an open-air factory.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Officers in blue uniforms which barely read &lsquo;CUSTOMS&rsquo; photograph the containers, check the papers and cut the security strips with utility knives to verify the contents.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This is Constanta South Agigea&nbsp;cargo port, where vehicles transport the containers from the free zone to a customs broker company, which fills in the requested documents for the import of merchandise into Romania.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The containers are then inspected by a joint team of Customs officers and border police, assisted by an organized crime unit. The containers are scanned by a machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">If any are suspicious, the customs and border police crack open the container and check every item inside - a process which can last up to a day.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">If they find counterfeit products during the inspection, they are seized by the Customs and a criminal prosecution starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The security staff pay increased attention to imports from high-risk regions South East Asia, China, Thailand and the Middle East.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Nevertheless only a fraction of the containers undergo such a rigorous examination.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Fighting a counterfeit wave: Only a tiny number of containers are examined by customs officers (picture: Adrian Mogos)\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/perfume%205.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 945px; \\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">According to the Romanian Border Police, the peak of seized counterfeited cosmetics was 2008 when the numbers of captures totaled 433,000 perfumes - about 1,000 per cent higher compared to 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The most counterfeit perfumes relate to Versace, Chanel, Prada, Gucci, Bvlgari, Boss, Thierry Muglier, Dior, Nina Ricci and Givenchy because of their high value on the open market.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The majority of fakes originate from China, Turkey, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But the route to Europe is either overland from Turkey to Bulgaria and Romania or by sea from China to Romania - making the eastern EU country a target for fake cosmetic traffic.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">28 days later</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">I followed up one recent case to see how this system worked.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On 31 August 2012, a joint team of Customs inspectors and Coast Guard officers discovered almost 2,000 bottles of eau de toilette in one container.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">All the products carried the names of different premium scent brands. The importer was Good Price Diverscom SRL, a Romanian company established 28 days earlier, with a line in retailing household goods.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The registered company&rsquo;s headquarters was in a small village outside Bucharest. The sole owner and manager is Galina Zubco. Born in 1957 in the Republic of Moldova, she has both Romanian and Moldovan citizenship.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Zubco confirmed to me that the eau de toilette had been ordered online with a company in China, but claims they were not &lsquo;branded&rsquo; at this time.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We showed the Chinese catalogues with the perfumes to our clients and they placed the order,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The perfumes depicted in the catalogues did not have any brand on them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">She argues that the products were confiscated after a tip-off from an &ldquo;anonymous snitch&rdquo; to the Financial Guard (the Romanian equivalent of the IRS).&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But, she adds, the prosecutors did not start a criminal investigation because there was no financial loss for the brand-owner.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After suspect cosmetics are seized by the authorities, the trademark owner - such as Chanel or Versace - is notified by the Customs and Border Police in order to take action.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The trademark owner or their representatives decide whether the products are counterfeit and whether to take further steps. The Romanian authorities are notified by the trademark representative of this decision.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Usually these products are destroyed by the Police at the trademark&rsquo;s expense, but there are cases when the owner decides that such a crime does not significantly infringe their property rights.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In this case, the perfumes can be returned to the importer.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">With Zubco&rsquo;s company, she claims the brand-owner of the counterfeit products never gave her any notice that the items were fake.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">If representatives of brand owners do not complain, the state authorities have no power to intervene in the passage of what could be illegal and potentially dangerous cosmetics onto the open market posing as luxury items.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Therefore counterfeit perfumes can reach customers in the streets.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The trademark owner representatives&nbsp;either does not reply to our solicitations or the seized quantity is too small and, because of the financial crisis, they do not perform an analysis on the products because this costs a lot,&rdquo; says chief-commissioner Gabriel Calimente, specialist officer on intellectual property rights - IPR - in the Romanian Coast Guard.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The warehouse where the seized perfumes and cosmetics are stored in Constanta Sud Agigea sea port is a hangar the height of four stories.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Inside under a padlock, the large boxes with counterfeit products lie on four huge metal stands. On the boxes one can read &lsquo;Certier&rsquo; instead of Cartier or &lsquo;Chonel&rsquo; instead of Chanel.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"A nose for crime: customs officer Eduard Gheorghe examines a counterfeit haul (picture: Adrian Mogos)\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/perfume%201%20Eduard%20Gheorghe%20Cusmtos%20officer%20in%20Agigea%20harbour.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 945px; \\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">Eduard Gheorghe wears his sunglasses slyly on his forehead while he walks around the large boxes. No one could notice he is one of the 70 customs officers in Constanta Sud Agigea unless one sees the small logo on the sleeve of his left upper arm.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;There are&nbsp;two types of counterfeit perfumes,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Those with identical designs to the known brand and those with a name and logo where only one letter differs from the original.\\\"</p><p style=\\\"\\\">When &lsquo;real&rsquo; perfumes are due to enter the country, the brand owner informs the customs prior to its arrival, giving details of the transport container.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">If a Chanel or Paco Rabanne batch turns up unannounced, the customs and border police then seize the cache.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">According to the Constanta Sud Agigea Customs the counterfeit perfumes rate of seizure grows every year.&nbsp;The largest in a single transport was performed in December 2012 with a value of 1.4 million Euro.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Customs overwhelmed&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Constanta South Container Terminal (CSCT) is known as &ldquo;a state within a state&rdquo; and its employees wear deadly weapons on sight. The Customs and Border Police officers are not allowed inside the area where the containers are unloaded from ships, or if they did the inspection must be previously announced.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">CSCT is a company established in December 2003 with an off-shore parent firm registered in the British Virgin Islands: DP World Gold Port Limited.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The company owns the sea port terminal in Constanta Sud Agigea which has operated since April 2004.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At the end of 2003 the Romanian government organized a public bid to lease the terminal for 20 years.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The bid was won by CSCT, which has been established few days prior to the bid. The company was owned at the time by the Dubai Port Authority - one of the three largest Dubai state owned companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The present terminal capacity is 1.3 million TEU &ndash; standard container &ndash; with a plan of reaching 3.5 million.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This capacity overwhelms the 70 customs officers working in Constanta Sud Agigea. Due to the insufficient personnel and poor equipment, it is no wonder hundreds of containers with fake perfumes reach the European Union through this terminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On average the value of fake perfumes in a single container, which is the size of a lorry, is about one to three million Euro.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Unwilling to react&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Official organizations paid to track counterfeit goods refused to talk about this boom in fake cosmetics which threatens their member base and deceives consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The European Anti-Counterfeiting Network, known as &lsquo;React&rsquo;, is a non-profit organization based in the Netherlands. It has over 20 years of experience in the counterfeit field and 190 members in fields such as cosmetics, tobacco and pharma.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">React undertakes enterprise raids and legal formalities in almost all EU countries. When asked about counterfeited perfumes, a React official from the headquarters refused to give any comment and directed me to a lawyer in Romania.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Gabriel Turcu is a lawyer who also represents the majority of perfume producers in Romania and the person contacted by authorities when property rights in perfume industry are violated. He initially agreed to talk about the fake perfumes and the black market, but changed his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">React officials in China and Turkey also refused such solicitations.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The perfume producing companies had conflicting reactions when asked about the black market and their fight against fake perfumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Chanel and Procter &amp; Gamble Prestige, the producer of Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Escada, among others, commented on the issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Versace expressed its regrets at not wanting to talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Prada, Hugo Boss, Gucci and Bvlgari would not give an answer.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">A Chanel official said the counterfeiting in Europe represents a two billion Euro per year business which leads to the loss of 100,000 jobs and the loss of tax earnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The Chanel official also stressed that the French legal system has been reinforced in the last few years following a large public awareness campaign by the luxury industry. In France any person who makes, imports or distributes counterfeit products risks two to three years imprisonment and a fine between 150,000 to 300,000 Euro.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Chanel was among the first company to create an internal structure to fight against this affliction, and also against reselling on parallel markets, including selling stolen products.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Procter &amp; Gamble Prestige said the company is committed to being &ldquo;rigorously disciplined&rdquo; in ensuring that the products are only available in authorized retailers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We have established working relationships with Romanian Border Police and Custom who are doing a very good job,&rdquo; read a statement. &ldquo;This is an industry issue (n.r. &ndash; counterfeiting), but we take it very seriously.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Kids victimized&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Children have become victims of low quality and fake perfumes. In 2011, three girls aged between 12 and 13 in Baia Mare, north Romania, ended up in Intensive Care after spraying themselves with a lilac-style perfume, believed to have originated from China.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The girls were diagnosed with nausea and dizziness - in one of hundreds of cases annually of damage caused by low quality cosmetics.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Counterfeit products are very toxic,&rdquo; says under-commissioner Aurel Dobre, a specialist officer on property rights within the Romanian General Police Inspectorate.&nbsp;&ldquo;The risk for health is huge. The individual who fabricates the fake perfume wants to keep a low cost. If a genuine perfume costs 250 lei (57 Euro), a similar brand but fake costs 50 lei (11 Euro). This fake is bought from an illegal warehouse at a third of the price asked for in the streets.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Romania&rsquo;s National Authority for Consumers&rsquo; Protection (NACP) admits there is a phenomena of counterfeit cosmetics.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">From 100 cosmetic producers, importers, distributors and sellers under inspection, more than 65 per cent were found to have irregularities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Between 2007 and 2013, NCAP inspectors penalized the industry with almost 3,500 fines, totaling around 1.9 million Euro.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Every year the authority receives 260 complaints about cosmetics - almost one per day.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This field of piracy and counterfeit was flagged in red by the European Commission, prompting the Romanian General Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office under the Supreme Court of Justice to create in February 2006 a working group&nbsp;to fight against such traffic.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Monica Pop is a prosecutor who runs the department in the General Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office and says Romania is one of the EU member states with strong legislation in the field.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">However she says the prosecutors&rsquo; investigation has become more complex, now that crime has moved onto the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The e-commerce of fake perfumes has exploded,&rdquo; adds police under-commissioner Aurel Dobre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The increasing rate of selling fake perfumes on-line at wholesale and retail level has also caught the attention of Europol.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Both Europol and Interpol warn the selling of counterfeit products is an important revenue source for organized crime networks and financing for terrorism.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This is because the property right crimes are often seen as less dangerous than trafficking in drugs or weapons - a perception that gangsters are now exploiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Europol&rsquo;s Organized Crime and Assessment Unit (OCTA) made public reports showing the most important country of origin for counterfeit perfumes, toys or textiles is China, where Chinese organized crime groups were involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This merchandise often pass through free zones in United Arab Emirates, says one report, where the trace of the fake products is lost and a new logo resembling the genuine article is printed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">That is why Europol says the largest seizures on the EU border of counterfeit products originate from the Emirates.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Camorra &ndash; the Neapolitan mafia and &lsquo;Ndrangheta &ndash; the Calabrian mafia have connections with the Chinese mafia to bring such products into Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The majority of fake perfumes are sold in the streets by well organized groups. Many of them quit trafficking drugs to focus on trading fake perfumes because the public does not view this crime as serious, while the profits are substantial and the punishment is relatively small.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Corruption via Turkey&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">One of the largest criminal network operating with fake perfume was dismantled by the Romanian Organize Crime Unit [DIICOT] in 2010 after one year of surveillance.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The network was run by three Turkish citizens living in Belgium and The Netherlands. Some of the 24 members are already convicted, others are waiting for a court decision. According to the prosecution, the network leaders used border policemen and customs from Romania and Bulgaria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Eight containers reached the EU with fake perfumes from China and Turkey. In total the value of the eight transports was about 35 million Euro. From the eight transports, the Romanian and Hungarian authorities seized five and put the remaining three under surveillance from Romania to Belgium to trace the real beneficiary of the fake merchandise.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Some of the network&rsquo;s members ended in jail for 15 years. They were charged with corruption, initiation of an organized crime group, smuggling, counterfeiting trademarks, forgery and money laundering. Others are still waiting the court decision.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The leader, Mustafa Avci, was at the time of the Romanian prosecutors&rsquo; investigations, under indictment in Germany for initiating an organized crime group which smuggled cigarettes from China to EU through Antwerp.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In March 2009, Mustafa Avci, a Dutch citizen living in Belgium, Vahdet Alibeyogullari in The Netherlands and Vedat Vurgun in Romania - all of whom are of Turkish origin - set up a business in the import of counterfeit perfumes from China and Turkey and sold them in Western Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The order for the fake perfumes was placed in China to a company located in the outskirts of the Zhongshan city, near the South China Sea. The fake perfumes were loaded on the ships in a port not far away from Hong Kong with the destination of Constanta Sud Agigea. The shipping papers claimed the containers held plastic mannequins.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The business HQ was in Sibiu, a Transylvanian city and 2007&rsquo;s European Capital of Culture. As part of the network was a Custom officer from Romania who received 3,500 Euro for each load he did not inspect. Another 3,000 Euro was for a border policeman on the Romanian&ndash;Hungarian frontier. Officially, the lorries brought ceramic toilet bowls into Romania. The network also used non-existing companies as destination or shipping companies whose names had been used without their knowledge.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">To finance the Chinese orders, Avci&rsquo;s network brought fake perfumes from Turkey by lorries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Each week a truck left Istanbul and passed through Burgas, where the network had a Bulgarian Customs officer. The perfumes entered into Romania through the Giurgiu border check point - a Danube river town established in 14th century by the Genovese traders and controlled for centuries by Ottoman empire -&nbsp;before traveling to Sibiu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Daniela Stanciu is a Border Police officer in Giurgiu working for the cross-border organized crime unit.

A sleepy collection of houses winds along the pebbled riverbed of the Alazani river, one village after the other linking like pearls on a string.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Slender, veiled women chat beneath a mulberry tree. Cows stand in the middle of a narrow country lane. Men with beards roll by on bicycles.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The scene is peaceful and banal - a sharp contrast to the&nbsp;headlines this valley in the north east of Georgia inspires in the local and&nbsp;foreign press.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Fighters in Syria&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jihadist Hotbed&rdquo;, &ldquo;arms smuggle&rdquo; and &ldquo;aspiring terrorists&rdquo; are the buzz words associated with Pankisi.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">If one mentions a trip to the valley in the Georgian capital Tbilisi, it will raise eyebrows among the locals - followed by a half-serious and hesitant question: &lsquo;Isn't it dangerous?&rsquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;These rumors are not true,&rdquo; 27-year old Asma* tells us with a frown. She is running a guesthouse in Pankisi, and has heard such fears before.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Yes, young men from the valley have gone to fight for the so-called Islamic State (IS, ISIL or ISIS) in Syria and Iraq.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Maybe 200, a woman guesses, not more than 50, says someone else, perhaps 20 or 25, is the final estimate -&nbsp;way fewer than from the UK.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">No one knows the exact number, but many young men have gone to nearby Turkey in search for work. And sometimes they don't come back, like 18-year old Beso Kushtanashvili, who was thought by his family to be working in a textile factory and died&nbsp;in armed clashes a few weeks ago - although his&nbsp;full story is still unclear.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">According to reports, he is the sixth Georgian national from Pankisi killed&nbsp;in Syria.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For the locals, fates like this are not just personal tragedies, they also taint the name of the valley.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">It is not the first time that Pankisi has received international attention: it had a dubious reputation back in the early 2000s, when the Georgian government conducted several 'anti-terror' operations in the valley. The two Chechen wars in the 1990s brought thousands of refugees across the Russian border, among them former independence fighters &ndash; a security risk in the eyes of the Georgian government and its close ally, the United States.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Such turmoil has calmed and the villagers try to live a normal life, but the shadow of suspicion is difficult to escape. Asma knows this.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;We are trying to present a different image of Pankisi, our traditions and the beautiful nature all around. But journalists are just interested in what they call 'terrorists'.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Respecting hospitality unto death&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Three years ago Asma left her job as a lawyer in Tbilisi and returned to Pankisi to set up a guesthouse in her family home.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">As part of an initiative to build&nbsp;agritourism in Pankisi, she took a&nbsp;training course supported by the Polish Foundation of Intercultural Education in 2007 and found an English business partner to help establish her guesthouse.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Her parents grow their own vegetables, keep cows and turkeys, and cook for the guests. Sunlight blinks through a roof of vine leaves as we sit in the courtyard. A cock crows in the distance. The silhouette of the mountains glows on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The majority of Pankisi&rsquo;s population are Kists, an ethnic tribe with Chechen origins. Around two hundred years ago their ancestors fled from poverty and conflicts across the mountains to Georgia, and have lived here ever since&nbsp;as hunters, farmers or shepherds.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The great 19th century Georgian poet Vasha Pshavela describes the Kists as a vengeful yet honorable people, who were locked in blood feuds with their neighbors but would respect the laws of hospitality, even unto death.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Today relations between Kists and their Georgian neighbors are peaceful, if distant.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Even though we speak Georgian and we love this country, we still keep our own identity,&rdquo; says 86 year-old Khaso, the director of the Ethnographic Museum in Duisi, the oldest village of Pankisi.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He sits in the cool office of the museum, where old tools, pottery and a vast sheepskin coat are exhibited between bare, white walls. The kists&rsquo; identity, according to Khaso, above all respects the opinions of elders. In critical situations, the rulings of the council of elders is law.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Two years ago, we are told, a young woman disappeared from Duisi in broad daylight, kidnapped by a local police officer who had been courting her.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The act of bride theft is centuries old, mocked in the cult Soviet comedy <a href=\\\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x12l7q0_kidnapping-caucasian-style-1967-pt-1_creation\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&lsquo;Kidnapping Caucasian Style&rsquo;</a> from 1967.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The council of elders was duly called upon and the families assembled below the walnut trees by the river. The discussion lasted all day, until finally a bride price was agreed. The couple now live in Denmark with their child.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;In Georgia, many people have lost their face - we try to keep it,&rdquo; Khaso says, just before he turns to walk home, slow and upright.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Nature-rich, cash-poor: Duisi with the Caucasian foothills in the background\\\" and=\\\"\\\" but=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" everything=\\\"\\\" fresh=\\\"\\\" good=\\\"\\\" has=\\\"\\\" jobs=\\\"\\\" pankisi=\\\"\\\" peace=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Pankisi%202.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 843px; \\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;There is peace, but nothing to do&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">This 'keeping face', however, is not easy, especially for the younger generation of Pankisi, who struggle to earn a living. On a gravelled alleyway in Duisi we meet 26-year old Mohammed cruising around with his bicycle and his two brothers; arms bristling with strength, feet slowly peddeling.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In the semi-darkness of their wood-paneled living room, the&nbsp;young men sit at a distance from us.&nbsp;Their female cousin&nbsp;laughs, puts&nbsp;her&nbsp;toddler to the side and serves coffee in small porcelain cups, sweet and strong. The&nbsp;three brothers&nbsp;came to Pankisi 12 years ago as refugees from Chechnya.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Do they like it here?</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Mohammed says from the corner. &ldquo;We have everything here: fresh air, water, good soil, mountains; there is peace.&rdquo; He shrugs his shoulders. &ldquo;Only, we have nothing to do.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">With the fall of the Soviet Union came the decline of the agricultural industry in the valley. Towards the end of the 1990s, the two Chechen wars swept a tide of refugees over the border.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">At its peak, in 2002, there were up to 7,000 refugees in the small community. Today the population is estimated at 10,000 local Kists and 2,500 former refugees. These pressures were too much for the local economy.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Despite the UN refugee agency (UNHCR)&rsquo;s attempt at financial relief, the unemployment rate in the valley still reaches 90 per cent. People aren&rsquo;t starving &ndash; jobless statistics do not count the informal economy common in rural areas &ndash; but the disintegration of old lifestyle patterns is palpable.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The lack of prospects force many young people to move from the valley to Tbilisi. A large number travel to Turkey in search for work, as was supposed in the case of young Beso Kushtanashvili, or else Europe, or the Chechen capital Grozny.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Among those who stay, a few find jobs in the local agricultural industry or as mountain guides in the slowly developing tourist industry.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Increasingly, the red brick mosque in the centre of Duisi has become a popular meeting place for young men in search of&nbsp;meaning.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Fighters paid with cash&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Those who come to the mosque&nbsp;find an alternative source of affirmation in what is frequently referred to as the &ldquo;Wahhabi&rdquo; brand of Islam.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Wahhabism is an influential and conservative interpretation of the Qur'an that has often been cited by commentators as the ideology of Islamic extremists. Since the 1990s it has supposedly spread throughout Pankisi, supported by sponsors from Saudi Arabia, where Wahhabism is the state religion.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The Kists, in contrast to their&nbsp;Christian Georgian neighbors, are traditionally&nbsp;Muslim. During the Soviet Union, the Kists practiced a liberal Islam, influenced by the Sufi tradition.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The new 'face' of Wahhabism helps young men to deal with their failure in terms of the Kists' traditional gender roles. Society expects young men to provide for their whole family. When there are no jobs available, they spend more time in the mosque, some of which are built from Saudi money - and can be tempted by radicalism.</p><p style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"Duisi alleyway: With 90 per cent unemployment, Pankisi sees its young leave for Europe and the Middle East\\\" class=\\\"pull-right\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Pankisi%203.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 843px; \\\"></p><p style=\\\"\\\">Moreover, the Kists&rsquo; close association with the Chechen cause arguably adds another motivation for joining the fighting in Syria.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">As far back as the 1990s, Islam has taken on a new role for many Chechens. The fervent nationalism for Chechen independence from Russia at the time was increasingly fueled by a strict Wahhabism.&nbsp;The fight for Chechen&nbsp;autonomy became a fight against infidels, a Jihad.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">But next to religious and nationalist fervour, there is a mundane reason which inspires young men to join the army of Islamic warriors: cash. It is not clear how much or whether those fighters get paid at all, but the word on the street certainly suggests it.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Even the most famous of IS fighters from Pankisi, the 28-year old, red-bearded commander Omar Al-Shashani, 'the Chechen', appears to have followed this calling only after he failed to find employment at home.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The son of a Christian father and a Muslim mother, he fought for the Georgian army in the 2008 conflict with Russia. When he was dismissed from the army due to tuberculosis, he returned to Pankisi, but was unable to find work.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">After a prison stint for arms smuggling, he decided to leave for Syria, where he quickly ascended the ranks of the IS forces and is now at large as one of the most prominent faces aiming to build an Islamic Caliphate.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">His story shows the tragic failure of the Georgian state and society to deal with the struggle of young Kists. The attention of both government and media focuses on the sensational wrongdoings of the few, rather than the deeper sources of the general problem.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Georgian answer: training counter-terrorists?</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Instead of stepping up its efforts to support the region of Pankisi in its economic development, the Georgian government has reportedly offered to host a training camp for anti-IS fighters as &ldquo;counterterrorism training center for any nationality&rdquo;, as Georgian ambassador in the US, Archil Gegeshidze, told the magazine Foreign Policy.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Although the Georgian State Security and Crisis Management Council later denied such plans, foreign minister Maja Panjikidze restated the countries intention to fully support &ldquo;efforts of the coalition to defeat ISIL and to bring peace in the region.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Meanwhile, the Kist community in Pankisi is struggling to improve their situation on their own, by showing a different side of their valley. The foreign visitors who venture to these foothills find a whole programme to gain insights into the culture of the Kists, be it visiting shepherds, going on expeditions to the mountains or listening to the female singing ensemble, which still practices traditional Sufi chants.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">As evening falls in Pankisi, the horses graze below the walnut trees by the river, their warm bodies almost turned to shadows. From the half-light emerges a man on a horse, riding bareback and caught in a furious gallop. He races by&nbsp;and soon he disappears into the blue haze of the mountains.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">We don't know into what future he is heading, but we have learned that there is no single path for Pankisi, no single story to fit into one line.&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">*Name changed by the editor</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"d5146ea2-6756-422a-a7ab-892aa215bbe7\"}]"}, "pk": 1182, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

But for many of the thousands of Moldovans then working in Sochi, this technicality hardly mattered.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Within two days, Mihai and his younger cousin, Iura, were&nbsp;travelling the 1,200 km by bus to the Olympic city.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">He left&nbsp;his wife knowing he might not be present for the birth of their son.

We were waiting to get them.\\\"</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The pair wore gloves, but received no proper safety training, nor was there a qualified safety officer around.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"We were told to be careful,\\\" says Iura. &ldquo;That was our training.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">On Wednesday 11 September, the men were working on the cables as usual, stretching them across long metal fences on the perimeter. Iura finished early and was cleaning up the site before lunch.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"Then I heard shouting,\\\" he says. \\\"I could see the barbed wire above my head twitching. At first, I didn't realise what happened.\\\"</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Despite assurances from site bosses that the electricity was off, a live cable left by another worker hung low on the fence.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">No one saw it. But somehow Mihai's head touched the cable, electrocuting him and throwing his body several metres back. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">As Mihai's body turned blue, co-workers tried to revive him. But their efforts were futile. He died instantly.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">With an ambulance and the police on the way and a dead body lying in the dirt, local security guards forced Iura and his co-workers away from the site.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"They knew we didn&rsquo;t have permits, so they didn&rsquo;t want any problems,\\\" he says. The following day the police called him in for an interview.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"They asked a lot of questions,\\\" he says. \\\"What happened? How did we get there? They kept asking about the work permits, but I didn&rsquo;t say much.\\\"</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The police released Iura without taking any formal statements.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Later that day Mihai's older sister Ana arrived in Sochi to identify the body.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"I saw the shape of his face, his hair...\\\" she says. \\\"He looked as though he was asleep.\\\"</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Two days after Mihai's death, the police released his remains, promising to investigate the incident. Over one year later, the Russian authorities still have not provided the family with a report into Mihai's death. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Ana left the morgue with Mihai's body and several official documents, including a Russian death certificate, signed by two doctors from the coroner's office in the administrative HQ in&nbsp;Krasnodar city.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The papers, obtained by theblacksea, includes two key inaccuracies: That Mihai died on the construction site of the Formula One racetrack, also under construction in Sochi.

So the likelihood that over three-quarters of the deaths were Moldovan alone is slim.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In a statement to reporters, the Labour Inspectorate claimed that \\\"the safety of workers was ensured\\\" in Sochi and that worker fatalities at the games site were \\\"four times less than the average\\\" for Russia's construction industry as a whole.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">By contrast, the UK suffered no worker fatalities during the construction of the 2012 Olympic Games.

These numbers come from the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia, the Ministry of Interior, local hospitals and airports shipping coffins to Uzbekistan.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Some of the deaths, he says, are from natural causes, such as heart failure, but also include accidents and racist murders. 42 per cent of the dead, nearly 18,000, died on Russian construction sites.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Abdujabbarov tells&nbsp;theblacksea that at least 120 Uzbeks were killed during the construction of Olympic facilities.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"There is a mixture of reasons for workers&rsquo; deaths,\\\" he says, \\\"but the main culprits are employers. Dangerous work was conducted by people without professional education and without proper control.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"Another problem was that people had to work without any rest...\\\" he adds, \\\"sometimes without even sleeping... Some workers died due to lack of concentration because they were exhausted.\\\"</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Since his release from prison last month, Abdujabbarov has fled Uzbekistan and is&nbsp;in hiding, unable to return to Russia or to his wife.</p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><em style=\\\"\\\">Olympic construction firm: \\\"millions\\\" paid in bribes</em></p><p class=\\\"p1\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Migrants' rights also struggled under the climate of corruption infecting the games.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">With a 50 billion-dollar price-tag, the global sporting event suffered widespread accusations of graft in how the state organised the construction contracts.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The Russian state firm overseeing the Games, Olympstroi, saw its employees investigated for embezzlement in 2012, but so far there are&nbsp;no formal charges. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">In 2010, Russian officials also opened a probe&nbsp;into Vladimir Leschevsky, former government official in the Department of President&rsquo;s Affairs supervising construction contracts, for accepting bribes.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Valery Morozov, former head of Russian construction company Moskonversprom, now living exile in Britain, tells&nbsp;theblacksea that he personally paid millions in black money to Leschevsky.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">The official, he says, would then pressure him to subcontract work to a group of ex-Yugoslavian companies. One of these companies was Putevi Uzice, based in Serbia, owned by businessman Vasilije Micic.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Putevi received hundreds of millions of Euros in contracts to build or reconstruct sites in Sochi, including the city's airport, and the Hotel Kamelia, a luxury 5-star resort. Despite the huge money flows, several employees and NGOs accused Putevi of failing to pay wages.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">One Moldovan worker, Misha, worked illegally in Sochi for Putevi from 2012 to 2014. He tells theblacksea that he knew of at least seven workers who died working for Putevi alone. &nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">\\\"Three of them were from Uzbekistan,\\\" he says, \\\"and Putevi paid to cover them up.\\\"</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Putevi did not respond to journalists' questions.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Charges against Leschevsky were eventually dropped, and the Government discreetly moved him to a different department. Morozov claims that the video evidence against Leschevsky is \\\"lost\\\". It was, he alleges, more likely used by the Russian secret service (FSB) to bribe the official.</p><p style=\\\"\\\">Talk of dead Uzbeks&nbsp;was rife in Sochi, according to workers there.

For poor families who need their children to earn cash, it can be more important than justice.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ahmet is only one of at least 150 children killed in work-related accidents in Turkey in the past three years, and one of the few that resulted in a \\\"successful\\\" prosecution. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Research by the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ) includes mapping the deaths between 2012 and the beginning of 2015<a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1205&amp;recType=story\\\"> [Click here for our data story</a>], highlighting how the Justice &amp; Development Party's (AKP) recent labor and education policies not only undermine Turkey's early progress in combating child labor, but also directly caused the deaths of at least five school pupils. &nbsp;</p><div>&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">When internships kill</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"Oguzhan dreamed of being a PE teacher - but he was electrocuted during work experience\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/NEW%20oguzhan.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 581px; height: 327px;\\\"></div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" id=\\\"docs-internal-guid-c6e24730-8175-13ac-a25d-9024f96fe609\\\">Seventeen year old Oguzhan &Ccedil;al&#305;skan was a pupil at STFA Technical &amp; Vocational High School in Gebze, two hours bus ride from Istanbul, on the Marmara Sea.</p><p>This is a conservative town and staunchly pro-government. The school is inside an industrial zone, set among factories - of which there are many. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Dilek &Ccedil;al&#305;skan, Oguzhan's mother, told us that he wanted to be a P.E. teacher. But the school ignored this ambition when choosing his apprenticeship.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Last summer, Oguzhan began a one month placement at a factory owned by Filli Boya, Turkey&rsquo;s largest paint company, to learn how to be an electrician.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">After weeks of heavy work he complained of being exploited. &ldquo;A couple of days before the accident, he came home and said he had put up 500 electrical cables,&rdquo; says Dilek. &ldquo;His hands were bruised and wounded.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Oguzhan was electrocuted on 15 July, 2014. He died in hospital 23 days later.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In a guarded interview, Filli Boya's human resources director, Tugba Cortelekoglu, refused to answer most questions about Oguzhan's death. She called the incident a \\\"tragic accident\\\", and claimed Oguzhan \\\"was not working with electricity\\\" at the time of his electrocution.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He is one of at least five pupils killed on apprenticeships under the AKP's 2012 education bill, dubbed 4+4+4.&nbsp;The law, which increases compulsory schooling from eight to 12 years, was welcomed by many. But critics argue that it forces students into technical schools where they undertake dangerous work for which they are unqualified and inexperienced.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In 2013, the first year of&nbsp;4+4+4, there were two fatalities: Faruk Dumlup&#305;nar, 17, from Denizli, west Turkey, was sent by his school to train as an electrician at an elevator repair company. When school restarted, the company continued to employ him, illegally.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">On Friday 12 September, when he should have been in school, Faruk was killed after a 30 year old lift he was repairing powered up. He was simultaneously crushed and electrocuted.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Eleven days later, 17 year old Ali Karkas from Manisa was hit by a car and killed while returning to his placement job at a mechanic garage.</p><p>In April 2014, 16 year old Ibrahim Can Duran was a student at a vocational school in &#304;neg&ouml;l, Bursa, also on the Marmara Sea. He was an apprentice at a metal workshop and was crushed under two tonnes of metal while unloading a truck.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Child labor, cheap labor</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Since AKP came to power in 2002 under the command of former-prime minister, now-president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's economy grew to the 17th largest in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Its economic miracle is largely based on manpower for construction, farming and textiles. In recent years, Turkey's economy has slowed and many experts fear an impending financial crisis. It has also struggled to provide the labor force to cope with the demands of its new free market economy. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Former Environment and City Planning Minister Erdogan Bayraktar said at a Ramadan dinner in Trabzon in August 2013 that \\\"Turkey&hellip; cannot raise inventors and we cannot invent.&nbsp;We are a country of technical, mid-level workers. So we need to educate our children accordingly.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The government saw the crisis coming. In 2010, the Ministry of Education began closing down the country&rsquo;s 1,500 state high schools, redistributing millions of students without the grades or finances to enrol in elite&nbsp;schools to Imam Hatip (religious schools), which train future religious leaders, and technical and vocational schools, where students learn trades.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When, in 2012, the government pushed 4+4+4 through the parliament without any consultation, it caused brawling between MPs and protests by unions. All argue that the law exacerbates child labor.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"I am certain child labor will rise considerably in the coming five to ten years,\\\" says Ozgur Ozel, Republic Peoples' Party MP for Manisa, west Turkey, and a member of the Health, Labor and Social Work commission.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Mehmet Onur Yilmaz, Education Policy Officer for G&uuml;ndem &Ccedil;ocuk, the Turkish child rights NGO who supplied us&nbsp;with child deaths data, says&nbsp;the new policy \\\"not only promotes child labor&rdquo;, but also perpetuates poverty and restricts upward mobility for underprivileged children.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;From a very early age children are condemned to an education and career path which restricts opportunities,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They are stuck at the job assigned to them, and for the rest of their lives will earn very little money.&ldquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">UNICEF's Turkey Representative Lieke van de Wiel rejects any notion that the corporatizing of schools encourages child labor, despite the five deaths.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"These [deaths] probably would have happened before 4+4+4, so I would not say it was triggered by it,\\\" says&nbsp;Van de Wiel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Turkey &ldquo;most dangerous&rdquo; in Europe for workers</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Most experts interviewed by us&nbsp;agree that the real number of fatalities&nbsp;is likely much higher than the 150 working children who have so far been confirmed dead.</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This phenomenon is symptomatic of a wider labor problem in Turkey. During AKP's tenure, over 15,000 workers have died. State opposition to labor rights movements is now more violent, particularly in the wake of protests after the Soma mine explosion, which killed 301 workers on 13 May 2014.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Turkey is now the most dangerous country in Europe to be employed, and finds itself blacklisted by the International Labor Organization (ILO) for its assault on unions and \\\"failure to change its laws to conform&rdquo; with its commitments.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In 1994, Turkey implemented ILO&rsquo;s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC) initiative. Child labor fell from over 2.2 million in 1994 to 886,475 in 2006, according to the Turkish Statistics Institute.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Since then, progress has retarded. IPEC ended most of its programmes in Turkey by 2007. It was, says&nbsp;Nejat Ko&ccedil;abay, programme officer for IPEC in Ankara, \\\"a decision made by ILO headquarters [in Geneva]&hellip;. there were countries more in need than Turkey\\\".</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In 2012, the number of child workers&nbsp;rose by 13,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In public, Turkish officials tout past successes, ignoring contrary evidence on child poverty and labor deaths.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In June 2014 deputy minister for Labor and Social Security, Halil Etyemez, who resigned his position earlier this year to run as an MP for Konya in this June's elections, which he won, announced to delegates at the 103rd Session of the ILO Conference in Geneva that &ldquo;child labor is no longer on Turkey&rsquo;s agenda.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Already that year, 20 children had died. By the end of the year, that number would rise to over 50. In 2013, it was 74.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But there seems to be a failure to acknowledge the facts.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the Turkish parliament on 9 January 2015, Etyemez's boss, Faruk &Ccedil;elik, Minister for Labor, responded to questions about child fatalities by claiming only &ldquo;one child worker under 15&rdquo; has died since 2001.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"The judge laughed in my face\\\"</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">International human rights organisations have accused the judiciary in Turkey of becoming a political theatre, used to extend government policies and chill criticism. Police have arrested and imprisoned journalists, military officials and protesters, mostly accused of involvement in anti-government terrorism. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For nearly two years Erdinc Eroglu, whose 16 year old son Eren was killed while illegally employed, has tried to hold to account those he believes are responsible for Eren's death.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Eren dropped out of school at 15. His parents wanted him to study, but school, said Erdinc, a retired business-owner from Istanbul, was \\\"a place Eren never liked.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Over the course of the next year, Eren worked several jobs before moving to TDS Digital Printing &amp; Advertisement Services Ltd (TDS Dijital Baski Merkezi ve Reklam Hizmetleri San. Tic. Ltd) in Yenibosna, a couple of miles north of the capital's Ataturk Airport, in September 2013.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Eight days later, on 31 October, Eren was dead, electrocuted by a low hanging power line while attempting to fix a sign at Doga private hospital. Photographs taken on the day reveal the shocking neglect for safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"Crime scene: Eren and a colleague, working on his first day, climbed onto the roof of the building on the left, a one-story clinic, and climbed a ladder (visible here) across to the hospital wall to fix a sign. Realising the danger, Eren pulled the ladder back. He was caught in a electrical field, and killed.  \\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/doga.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 595px; height: 334px;\\\"></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Exactly who is to blame will be debated at a fifth court hearing on 14 September this year. Erdinc believes that fault runs deep, including Doga, TDS, the Istanbul municipality, and the electrical company.&nbsp;Each organisation played a role in Eren's death, and each denies responsibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Since the accident, no attempt has been made to fix the danger. Much to the anger of Erdinc.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">On the first court hearing, Erdinc prepared like a lawyer to defend his son.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;When it was my turn, I said: &lsquo;The hospital still doesn&rsquo;t comply with the law. It needs to be shut down to prevent any more deaths&rsquo;.&nbsp;The judged laughed in my face.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want revenge&rdquo;</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In all the cases analyzed for this report, only the deaths of Ahmet, Oguzhan&nbsp;and Eren&nbsp;reached court. Ali Ko&ccedil; for Ahmet's death remains the only conviction, achieved because the Yildiz family capitulated to pressure from prosecutors and defense lawyers. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"In court, Ali Ko&ccedil;&rsquo;s lawyer told us we [G&uuml;ndem &Ccedil;ocuk] had wasted our time because the matter was now settled,\\\" says&nbsp;Ezgi Koman, coordinator at G&uuml;ndem &Ccedil;ocuk, who were trying to support the Yildiz family.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ezgi adds&nbsp;that Ahmet&rsquo;s father told the court the family no longer wanted to press forward with the case because they had received &ldquo;financial and moral compensation.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ahmet&rsquo;s brother, Tahir tells us: &ldquo;[Ali Ko&ccedil;] was extremely upset so we forgave him.&nbsp;I still see him around, his workplace is still here, we live in the same neighbourhood&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want revenge.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Tahir would not disclose how the matter was settled between the tribe members, but denies that the family received any &ldquo;blood money&rdquo; from Ko&ccedil;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ezgi says she understands why Tahir would not admit to accepting money. It would, she adds, be &ldquo;embarrassing to accept it openly.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Selcuk Kaygisiz, representative of the Platform for Ending Worker Deaths, an NGO set up to provide support to victims, says&nbsp;that interference is a common problem in securing convictions. \\\"Employers get involved very quickly.&nbsp;Families are so poor and they don't know the law, so they get intimidated by employers.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"It happens to us all the time,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t reach the families before the employers do.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Government \\\"shamelessly\\\" exploits mine disaster</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Turkey has never been pro-labor rights, but never before has it been so pro-business,&rdquo; says Mehmet Onur Yilmaz from Turkish Child Rights NGO G&uuml;ndem &Ccedil;ocuk.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">At the end of 2014, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security sent the worker safety bill to the General Assembly, which was&nbsp;largely a response to the fatal Soma disaster.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ozgur Ozel was one of the committee's members. He told us that just before the deadline, AKP members introduced an additional 25 amendments containing everything from tax reform to land rights.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;They used the Soma disaster shamelessly,&rdquo; says Ozel. &ldquo;The AKP saw an opportunity to pass other laws they wanted because it was a very easy process with no lengthy discussions.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He also tells of how they gutted the legislation, toning down punishments for companies who kill employees through negligence.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Public copies of the law show&nbsp;that the government removed a provision barring negligent&nbsp;companies from government contracts for a minimum of two years. They also reduced proposed financial penalties in the cases of worker deaths for the largest companies.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Most worryingly, they lowered the minimum working age for children from 15 to 14.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This age drop&nbsp;is likely designed to help businesses involved in&nbsp;4+4+4, and will have little effect among the largest employers of children and young people - small businesses and farms.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Turkish Labor Code already states that children between the ages of 14 and 17 cannot be employed in any hazardous work, and younger children cannot work at all. But exemption in the code nullifies all labor laws for agricultural businesses with fewer than 50 workers. For small businesses it is fewer than four.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">UNICEF's Social Policy Officer for Turkey, Iraz &Ouml;yk&uuml; Soyalp, rejects&nbsp;the idea that&nbsp;punishing employers who hire and kill children through neglect would send a message.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I do not think that increasing the punishment will make much of a difference,\\\" she says. \\\"Children are not working because the fines are too low, or because it's not a big deal to pay the fine. Even if you increase the fine&hellip; the child's life will not change\\\".</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ko&ccedil;abay from ILO disagrees.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"There should be, in my personal opinion, proper punishment and penalties for whoever is responsible,\\\" he says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"If the family is responsible, the neighbour, the government, or even we [organizations]&nbsp;whose purpose is to intervene, all of us should to take responsibility.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><em>The ILO estimates that 168 million&nbsp;children worldwide are engaged in child labor.</em></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><em>Neither the Turkish Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Education, AKP press office nor members of the Health and Safety sub-commission responded to requests for comment.</em></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Additional reporting by Mina Eroglu</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"bfa7bf6f-f76c-433f-988c-8cac3fe724e2\"}]"}, "pk": 1202, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

In 2013/14 five children aged between 14 and 16 died while picking the fruit.

Something to which both ILO and UNICEF lend their support.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The commission is a positive step, say many politicians and rights organisations, but half the deaths reported in the data are not related to agriculture or seasonal work, where most of the government, UNICEF and ILO programmes are focused.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Last year, the AKP-run Grand Assembly refused to consider a proposal to set up a commission to investigate child labor deaths in general. The reason was party politics, argues Ozgur Ozel, the Republic Peoples' Party (CHP) MP who authored the proposal.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ozel, who represents Manisa in west Turkey, tells us&nbsp;that the AKP routinely snubs proposals not presented by its own members. In ten years, he said, there were &ldquo;2,000 proposals from CHP members to set up commissions.

Places of worship are not compulsory for a belief system to spread - especially in Islam. This [plan]&nbsp;is not about worship, it is about marking the territory of their authority through a monument. It is quite difficult to argue that this is something that Islam would accept.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Turkey is rivalling the mosque diplomacy enacted by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States in the last two decades, where the oil-rich countries renovated and constructed mosques around the world, as a means to seek political influence.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">But these countries mostly follow an ultraconservative Wahhabist doctrine, which grew dynamically since the 1970s, after the tapping of the Arabian peninsula&rsquo;s oil reserves showered the countries with wealth.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Turkey sees a gap in the market for its &ldquo;mild&rdquo; brand of Sunni Islam, which includes women-friendly mosques and an intolerance of extremist rhetoric.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Western leaders view Turkish Islamic expansion as more favourable than the spread of places of prayer from rogue Imams or what they view as the radicalism of Wahhabism.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Turkey&rsquo;s new places of worship are mixed with cultural centers, places of learning, shops and cafes - indicating that these &ldquo;mega-mosques&rdquo; aim to act as showrooms selling the concept of Turkish Sunni Islam.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">But while critics accuse Erdogan of neo-Ottomanism, Turkey seems conscious of the mixed reaction from nation states to its imperial past when soliciting locations for mega-mosques.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The Black Sea's research shows that no giant mosques are planned for European countries who have a major historic beef with the Ottomans, such as Armenia, Greece or Austria - nor in the larger Arab nations that were part of its former Empire.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Turkey is also planning mega-mosques in nearly all major European countries - except the Catholic ones.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">None are yet planned for Italy, Poland, Croatia, Slovakia, Austria, France, Belgium, Portugal or Spain.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">All the countries in Europe marked by a mosque on this map are either Orthodox or Protestant in their key religion.

If this is the situation in Turkey, then it will definitely create more problems abroad.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The newest projects have nothing to do with what Kerem Oktem calls a &ldquo;rather sensible and &lsquo;organic&rsquo; approach,&rdquo; of working with local Muslim communities to build or restore mosques.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Instead, he argues, President Erdogan is building &ldquo;palaces to his own power&rdquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Wherever possible Erdogan will open the mosques personally, and has even named a mosque in Somalia after his mother.</p><p>The clearest indication of this is the new Istanbul mosque at Camlica, a 60 million Euro mega-mosque with six minarets visible from the entire city, which will transform the skyline. Erdogan's political party of Justice and Development (AKP) does not hide that the Camlica mosque is a representation of its own legacy.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The aim of building this mosque in Camlica is to leave a symbol signifying the AKP party era,&rdquo; Minister of Environment and Urbanization, Erdogan Bayraktar, said in 2013.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Erdogan&rsquo;s ramping up of the mosque-building programme in the last two years may come from a fear of losing control over his country.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Erdogan&rsquo;s &lsquo;grand mosque programme&rsquo; is, above all, a function of his own delusions of grandeur, of his waning power and his growing impotence,&rdquo; says Oktem.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The AKP-led Government in Turkey in June lost its majority in the Turkish parliament, while the brutal crack-down on the protests in Istanbul&rsquo;s Gezi Square in 2013 brought international condemnation on Erdogan&rsquo;s government.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Senior figures close to Erdogan are facing rigorous corruption allegations. On 1 November Erdogan's party faces another election. The President is desperate to win a majority so that he can change the constitution to make him&nbsp;the head of Government&nbsp;and grant his office vast unchecked powers.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">This year alone Erdogan has opened a record number of giant mosques - in Kazakhstan, the USA, the Netherlands, Russia and Somalia, and three in Turkey.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;In this context, I would assume that part of these mosque building projects are intended to deflect attention from the fall from power of the AKP,&rdquo; says Oktem. &ldquo;I am not sure this programme has much to do with devotion to religion or ideology. It looks like a rather desperate attempt to be seen doing something other than corruption.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Anti-Capitalists Muslims Association&rsquo;s Ozgur Kazim Kivanc agrees that this is a diversion tactic targeting voters.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">\\\"This strategy is aimed at the Turkish electorate,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It is about&nbsp;[the AKP] getting more support from people and strengthening their authority by saying &lsquo;look at us, we are so powerful that we build these extravagant mosques for our religion.&rsquo;\\\"</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Asking Turks to pay up</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><br style=\\\"\\\">This expansion comes with a cost in the hundreds of millions of Euro. Turkey is undertaking this programme mainly through the office of Religious Affairs, Diyanet, a multi-billion Euro government-sponsored organisation which funds religious teaching at home and abroad.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The Turkish Republic in 1924 founded Diyanet to oversee&nbsp;affairs related to faith and worship of the religion of Islam, such as paying the salaries of Turkish and foreign imams. The aim was to separate religion from politics.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">But since Erdogan&rsquo;s AKP came to power in 2002, Diyanet has transformed into a propaganda vehicle serving and exporting Turkey&rsquo;s religious society.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Between 2004 and 2014 it expanded its staff from 72,000 to 120,000, while its annual budget is 1.7 billion Euro, nearly twenty times larger than its figure for 2001, and far higher than the Ministry of the Interior, which has the next highest budget at 1.1 billion Euro.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Sevgi Ozcelik, project coordinator of Human rights NGO the Helsinki Citizens Assembly stated in December 2014 that, due to its budget hike: &ldquo;Diyanet should be now considered as a strong political player, not an institution providing religious service.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">In 2014, this department became answerable to Prime Minister Davutoglu, in a move which some viewed as revealing Turkey had ended its 80-year history of separating religion from state politics.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Diyanet acts as the superior religious authority in Turkey, with its diktats and preaching.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">But while Turkey frames itself as the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; Islamic power of the Middle East, Diyanet seems to indicate otherwise.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Diyanet preaches against contraception, calls abortion &ldquo;murder&rdquo; and states couples should not hold hands outside before they get married.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">In addition, it has stated that tattoos are sinful and discourages men from wearing earrings or any jewellery.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Diyanet claims illegal downloading on the internet is against Islam.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The office also declares having a pet pooch is against Islam, because Muhammad said angels will never enter a house where there is a dog.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The office has implicitly supported the AKP&rsquo;s more controversial policies of the last few years, such as its bans on YouTube and Twitter and the police&rsquo;s use of pepper spray at protests.</p><p>Leading the way in building new mosques is Diyanet&rsquo;s own charity arm, the Diyanet Foundation. During prayers, Diyanet Imams collect money from mosque-goers, who feel obliged&nbsp;to give small amounts regularly.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">In pious neighbourhoods, the donations are higher - but with 86,000 mosques throughout Turkey and millions of worshippers, the sums collected can be significant.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">It is not clear how much of the financing for the Diyanet Foundation - which needs 100s of millions of Euro to build these foreign mosques - is from the collection plate, corporate donors or wealthy individuals. Or indeed Diyanet itself.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The foundation&rsquo;s donations in 2014 were 120 million Euro, compared to 50 million Euro in 2010. This figure has increased by almost two and a half times in four years, at a time when the country&rsquo;s growth rate tumbled from 12 per cent to two per cent.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Diyanet claims that none of its billion Euro publically funded budget is diverted to the Foundation's mosque projects abroad.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">But The Black Sea has uncovered a document showing that Diyanet has actually provided the Foundation with grants for the construction of mosques in the USA, Germany, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The document, a copy of a written answer to a parliamentary question raised in 2014, confirms that taxpayer money was spent on the mega-mosque projects abroad, but&nbsp;it does not disclose how much Diyanet transferred to its Foundation.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Diyanet president, Mehmet G&ouml;rmez states that Diyanet is &ldquo;guiding&rdquo; the massive mosque construction and donors are &ldquo;giving&rdquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;There are such lands where there are thousands of Muslims and yet there is not a single mosque,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;So [donors] are presenting alms to the Muslims of the world as a nation and these are returning to [them] in the form of blessings from the Almighty.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But Anti-Capitalists Muslims Association&rsquo;s Ozgur Kazim Kivanc warns that&nbsp;Diyanet is creating a &ldquo;state Islam&rdquo; based on the Sunni Islam of the Turkish majority.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Diyanet&rsquo;s increase in its financial power fits the ideology of the new national authority,\\\" he adds, \\\"that of&nbsp;creating a Sunni national identity.\\\"</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">For more information, click here:<a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=86&amp;idC=96&amp;idRec=1214&amp;recType=story\\\"> New mosque designs attacked as \\\"kitsch\\\" parody of Ottoman masterpieces</a></p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"fc10f7bb-4387-4082-9ca4-5cca59ab39f2\"}]"}, "pk": 1211, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

In fact, he won&rsquo;t reveal anything in Zarand, the Romanian village in Arad county where he has lived his entire life.</p><p>Instead, he gets into his car and puts his foot on the gas.</p><div>Only when he looks to his left and sees the village as a tiny reflection in his wing mirror, does he begin to explain how his land was stolen.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In June this year he was filing paperwork to the Arad county council, an official told him that a chunk of his farmland no longer belonged to him. It had been sold to some foreigners. The council would not tell him to whom.</div><div><br>\\\"This happened to lots of people in this village,\\\" Necrilescu says. &ldquo;It is our land, handed down to us by our parents, and it is not right that someone else can just become the owner.&rdquo;</div><div><br>Part of Necrilescu's land now belongs to Rabo Farm, a 315 million Euro land investment fund owned by Dutch banking giant Rabobank.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Rabo Farm has bought over 140 hectares of land in Zarand since 2012, and over 21,000 more in 50 villages across Romania since 2011, part of a tent to&nbsp;fifteen year investment which is expected to give returns of up to 900 million Euro to investors.</div><div><br>Zarand is stretched wide across the flat and fertile plains of western Romania, where small houses of rammed earth and breeze blocks sit alongside unpaved roads.</div><div><br>From the court of every house comes the restless noise of pigs and chickens, and, from the fields, the swishing of farmers cutting crops by hand.</div><div><br>The village is home to over 2,500 people, most of whom continue to scrape a living from small-hold farming, on plots returned to them by the state after the fall of communism in 1989.</div><div><br>All across Zarand, farmers tell the same story. They say that their land was taken from them, without their knowledge or any kind of payment. The land registered in their name was sold by someone else, often to foreign-owned companies.</div><div><br>Most are unaware of what exactly happened, as a full investigation is yet to happen. Where cases have been prosecuted, villagers say they received no explanation or compensation. But all are sure of one thing: the former village mayor, Ion Mot, was somehow involved.</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Mayor: \\\"took 40,000 Euro\\\" bribes to pass on land ownership docs</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Mot was forced to resign as mayor in September this year, two years after a conviction following an investigation by Romania's top prosecutorial body, the National Agency for Anti-Corruption (DNA), for his role in forging documents and stealing hundreds of hectares of land.</div><div><br>According to the DNA, Mot had taken 40,000 Euro in bribes in exchange for passing on villagers' land ownership documents to crooked businessmen, who used them to forge 'pre-contracts' to transfer the land into their own names.</div><div><br>Since 2013, Rabo Farm has bought over 140 hectares of land in Zarand from such &lsquo;intermediaries&rsquo;. From this total, at least 16.5 hectares were acquired by intermediaries through a complex procedure involving a judge who was recently convicted for fraud, and pre-contracts which are now under investigation by state prosecutors and anti-corruption officers.</div><div><br>Mircea Necrilescu's land is one of dozens of plots in Zarand sold to Rabo Farm in 2013. According to land registry and court records, Necrilescu sold land in 2010 to a woman called Elena Bosca.</div><div><br>Three years later, Rabo Farm bought Necrilescu's land from Bosca, along with land she acquired from at least 14 other villagers in Zarand. &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Bosca's method for obtaining ownership of the land is complex.</div><div><br>In 2010, Bosca took Necrilescu and 12 other villagers to court in the town of Ineu, claiming that they had reneged on a deal to sell her the land. She presented preliminary contracts, stating that the villagers had agreed to sell her almost 30 hectares in total.</div><div><br>The hearing was over quickly. Neither Necrilescu or any of the other defendants appeared or gave any defence. Necrilescu claims he did not know the hearing ever took place. But a judge named Florita Bolos, who was convicted last year to four years in jail for forgery and bribe-taking, ruled in Bosca's favour, granting her official ownership of the land and allowing her to sell it on to Rabo Farm.</div><div><br>Contrary to the evidence shown on court documents, when we contacted Bosca she said she had never met with Bolos. She also denied falsifying any documents.</div><div><br>This court case, and the ownership documents provided by Bosca, is now under a forgery investigation by state prosecutors.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The same procedure was used by another of Rabo Farm's intermediaries - Austrian-owned Bardeau Holding Romania, who have sold Rabo Farm hundreds of hectares&nbsp;of farmland across west Romania.</div><div><br>Through Judge Bolos, Bardeau Holding acquired land from at least 148 villagers in Zarand, at least seven of which now belong to Rabo Farm. Bardeau's dealings with Bolos over this land is now under DNA investigation.</div><div><br>An analysis of court records involving Rabo Farm's subsidiaries in Romania suggest that the pattern of buying land with contested ownership extends far beyond Zarand.</div><div><br>In Dolj county, south-central Romania, a Rabo Farm subsidiary called Kamparo Investment is being sued for buying land that the owner claims he never sold.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In another case from a court near the Bulgarian border, Kamparo Investment settled out of court after the company was sued by five landowners whose farmland they had bought through intermediaries. The landowners argued that their land had been illegally taken, after new and illegitimate ownership papers were issued by an office in the local council. Kamparo agreed to give them their land back.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><img alt=\\\"Bygone age: Romania's rural population is ageing fast - and investors are looking to cash in quick (picture: Petrut Calinescu)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/GetFileAttachment.jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9; width: 950px; float: right; height: 636px;\\\"></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Does Rabo Farm know who they were dealing with?</div><p>In a report published by the fund in 2013, Rabo Farm stated: \\\"Before we acquire or invest in a farm, we conduct an intensive due diligence analysis on sellers, leaseholders, farm operators, farms and many other factors relevant to the investment phase.\\\"</p><p>When we asked Rabo Farm what they knew about Elena Bosca, the fund responded: \\\"We performed a due diligence on the seller by an external party on all public sources. This includes all info in the public domain. The outcome was positive - the person was not involved in any criminal file or public scandals.\\\"</p><p>The fund gave a similar answer for Bardeau Holdings.</p><p>Despite their verification, Rabo Farm missed the fact that they were buying land in a village racked with corruption and land rights abuse, and from sellers deeply involved in murky business.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Villagers &ldquo;forced to hand over land&rdquo;</div><p>Rabo Farm's response also seems to miss the bigger picture. Corruption and poverty are entrenched characteristics of rural Romania, and when foreign money comes knocking on their door, it can often foster corrupt behaviour.</p><p>For example, these &ldquo;intermediaries&rdquo; also resorted to criminal activity for force small-holders out of their land. Through dozens of interviews and the analysis of hundreds of land registry and court documents, we found that a Rabo Farm subsidiary worked extensively with intermediaries who employed a criminally convicted scout called Gheorghe Papuc to find them land.</p><p>Elderly villagers describe how Papuc came to them in the middle of the night and harassed and tricked them into selling their land.</p><p>They were taken by bus to a nearby town along with dozens of others. Once there, they were taken into a block of flats and pushed into a small room with no lighting, where they were made to sign over their land ownership in front of a notary.</p><p>They were paid as little as 80 Euro per hectare, but say that the room and bus were kept dark so they were unable to count the cash until they returned home. No one we spoke to had any idea to whom their land had been sold.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Romanian institutions: &ldquo;sick with corruption&rdquo;</div><p>This year alone, the National Anti-Corruption Directorate have worked on over 6,000 corruption cases, the majority of them in remote towns and villages. All across the country villagers talk of how a few central figures - invariably revolving around the village mayor - have commanded control of local money flows, resources and employment opportunities. A local farmer in Zarand told us, on condition of anonymity: \\\"the mayor controls this village, and everyone is either working for him or lives in fear of him. You will not find anyone to speak to you as people are either scared, or on his side.&rdquo;</p><p>This is a problem of which investors should be aware. Andrei Macsut, a researcher at the Romanian anti-corruption watchdog Romania Curata, told us: \\\"our institutions are sick with corruption - it contaminates everything in Romania. When investors bring in large amounts of money, they end up supporting corruption by necessity as it is often the only way to get things done.\\\"</p><p>Rabo Farm argues that it has brought prosperity to deprived areas. In their report they wrote: &ldquo;Rabo Farm believes that its investments contribute to the local social and economic developments of the communities where it takes place and that it has a role in supporting these developments.&rdquo;</p><p>But the pursuit of land by foreign investors is not helping the endemic problems in rural Romania.</p><p>\\\"Romania is a characteristically agricultural country where farming occupies a large proportion of its population,&rdquo; says Attila Szocs works for Eco Ruralis, a Romanian NGO which has been investigating this issue for year. &ldquo;However, land grabbing drives peoples out of the rural landscape, generating a well-known trend in the west of rural exodus. If ageing population and youth migration were already becoming an issue in the rural areas, land grabbing accelerates the problem even more.\\\"</p><div>In Zarand, the illegal land grabs that have left much of the village without farmland, exacerbating the damage to an already ailing small-hold farming community. In the two and a half decades since communism ended, the smallholder economy has been eroded from all sides, first as foreign owned supermarkets drove down the value of agricultural produce, and then as the seed market was monopolized by multinationals.</div><div><br>Introducing herself as Mrs Pocriser through a crack in her gate on her the outskirts of Zarand, an elderly woman broke down in tears as she explained how her and her husband's land was robbed.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>\\\"It was only a small plot - a few hectares. But we used it to feed ourselves and to sell a little bit. Now it is gone; we have nothing left.&rdquo;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Rabo Bank: &ldquo;plan to invest in the land in the future&rdquo;</div><p>These findings appear to contrast starkly with Rabobank's reputation as one of the most responsible banks in the world, and raise important questions about the fund's commitment to due diligence and corporate social responsibility.</p><p>In their promotional literature, Rabo Farm talk repeatedly of their role in improving the quality of the land they buy. When we spoke to Dick Van Den Oever, the managing director of Rabo Farm, he told us that &ldquo;our work contributes towards food security and sustainable food production&rdquo;, and said that the fund is investing in infrastructure and necessary work to increase productivity on their farms.</p><p>However we spoke to tenants of Rabo Farm's land, farmers from prominent agricultural associations in areas where Rabo Farm own large amounts of land, and both small hold and industrial farmers who had come into regular contact with Rabo Farm. All said that the fund invests nothing in the land.</p><p>When we asked one tenant renting 1,000 hectares from Rabo Farm whether the fund is investing in improving the land, he replied: &ldquo;It is a lie. They just wait for the price to rise and then they will sell&rdquo;.</p><p>After we put this to Den Van Oever, he said the fund has so far invested very little in improving the land, but that they &ldquo;plan to invest in the land in the future&rdquo;.</p><p>The fund also claims to be consolidating farmland, which they say is vital for increasing productivity and boosting Romania's market capacity.</p><p>But an analysis of satellite imagery using land registry data and Romanian satellite software shows Rabo Farm appear to have bought fragmented plots of land with little apparent order, often with plots of a hectare or less situated alone, far from the next plot owned by the fund.</p><p>When we question Van Den Oever about this, he responded that yes, this is the case, and that the fund plans to consolidate the land in the future.</p><div>If this is to happen, it will involve buying more land in order to join the existing plots.</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Not farming the land: legal EU loophole exploited</div><p>Contracts drawn up between leaseholders and Rabo Farm suggest that the fund is exploiting a legal loophole which allows it to redirect European agricultural subsidies into its own coffers, despite not actually farming the land themselves.</p><p>Using an online Romanian database for contractual guarantees we have found that leaseholders are directly transferring their single area payment subsidies to Rabo Farm as a guarantee against rent, and in doing so moving the EU's primary agricultural aid away from farmers and into the hands of investors. In response to our questions about the redirection of subsidies, Rabo Farm claim that: \\\"This is in line with the law in Romania and many EU countries and is in favor of farmers.&rdquo;</p><p>In a teaser for Rabo Farm, the fund state that they expect an eight per cent annual growth in the value of their land, in line with the rapidly soaring price of farmland in the easternmost members of the European Union. After ten to 15 years, the fund plans to sell at up to three times the price they bought for.</p><p>The vast majority of Rabo Farm's profits go to Dutch and American pension funds. According to a report issued by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), Rabo Farm's investors include the Dutch pension funds APG and PZFW (formerly PGGM) and the American Fortune 100 retirement fund TIAA-CREF. Rabobank has not disclosed any information regarding investor inputs to the fund.</p><p>Last year, Rabo Farm initiated a second fund of 300 million Euro, in addition to the 315 million Euro they have so far invested.</p><p>The fund's manager Dick Van Den Oever said that they are still looking for investors, but hope to launch the fund in the first quarter of next year.</p><p>Titled 'Rabo Farm Fund II', the second fund expects Romania and Poland to be the prime targets.<br>However there is &ldquo;potential&rdquo; for expansion to other eastern European countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Romania's four million smallholders are sitting on a valuable resource: since 2012, the price of their land has seen a 25-fold increase (photo: Petrut Calinescu)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/agriculture%20in%20romania%2002.JPG\\\" style=\\\"width: 950px; height: 636px; float: right;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Land grabbing: &ldquo;A European problem&rdquo;</div><p>Sylvia Kay has been researching on the issue of agricultural justice since 2011, with the <a href=\\\"https://www.tni.org/en/bio/sylvia-kay\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Transnational Institute</a>. Earlier this year she co-wrote a report for the European Parliament titled 'Extent of Farm Land Grabbing in the EU', which argued that land grabbing in Europe has serious implications for food security, employment and welfare.</p><p>\\\"[Rabo Farm's activities] really paints an alarming picture of what is going on in Romania,\\\" she says. \\\"The European Commission currently leaves the entire issue up to member states and the sustainability policies of private investors. It is clear that is not enough.\\\"</p><p>The idea that land grabbing could be a European problem is new. The term has long been associated with the global south and the huge, often state-assisted takeovers of agricultural land and forest by western companies.</p><p>But in Europe, the concentration of land into fewer and fewer hands has become part of our political narrative, more often categorized under 'rural development' than economic crime. Each year, the European Commission provides billions of euros to companies buying up huge tracts of land in eastern Europe, on the premise that they are assisting in land concentration and driving up land prices.</p><p>For Romania's four million smallholders, this means they are sitting on a hugely valuable resource. Since 2012, the price of land in Romania has seen a 25-fold increase, and Rabo Farm believe it will continue to grow - albeit at a slightly slower rate. Often with little in the way of market savvy, smallholders have found themselves in the middle of a world of hungry investors, and they are the only thing standing in the way of them making an awful lot of money.</p><p>\\\"Romania is an example of a 'perfect storm' scenario,\\\" says Szocs. \\\"In its transitional economy, where access and control over strategic resources floated from a communist regime towards local oligarchs and then to corporate businesses, weak national land governance coupled with institutional corruption or passivity paved the way for large land grabs with far-reaching effects over the rural society.\\\"</p><p>There is a lack of transparency and control over land consolidation.</p><p>&ldquo;The European Commission tends to look at this issue through the lens of one its principle values, the free flow of capital between nation states,&rdquo; says Sylvia Kay. &ldquo;They trust on nation states and Corporate Social Responsibility. Stories like these show that this is not enough. More European oversight is needed, to ensure people remain in control of what happens to their land.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mircea Necrilescu&rsquo;s name has been changed</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Contributors to this story: <span style=\\\"font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-size: 14pt;\\\">&#536;tefan C&acirc;ndea, Andreea Pavel, Adrian Dumitru, Romuluis Dub&#259;&#539;, Adrian Mogo&#537;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This project was funded by the <span style=\\\"color:#FF0000;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://www.journalismfund.eu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">journalismfund.eu </a></span>and the <a href=\\\"http://www.bosch-stiftung.de/content/language2/html/programs-for-journalists.asp\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Robert Bosch Stiftung</a>&nbsp;and also appears in <a href=\\\"https://decorrespondent.nl/3583/De-Roemeense-investeringen-van-de-Rabobank-zijn-met-verhalen-over-corruptie-omgeven-Wat-zijn-onze-bevindingen-/266313641-9690322c\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">De Correspondent</a> (Holland)</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"9f135dcb-d028-480b-b504-b1392ec6a295\"}]"}, "pk": 1216, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

This is the political movement of 37 year-old Renato Usatii, a flamboyant Moldovan businessman who made his fortune running a railway parts factory in Russia.</p><p>I speak in Romanian &ldquo;Vreau sa vorbesc cu domnul Casu, va rog&rdquo; [I want to speak to Mr Casu, please]</p><p>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; comes the reply in mid-Atlantic English.</p><p>I explain who I am.</p><p>&ldquo;Come to my tent!&rdquo; says Casu. &ldquo;I can offer you some Che Guevara tea!&rdquo;</p><p>As November rain begins to beat&nbsp;down, I turn up at a heavily-patrolled&nbsp;camp of around fifty tents outside the Moldovan Parliament in the country&rsquo;s capital Chisinau.</p><p>Surrounded by police tape and overseen by bored and shivering cops, the Moldovan occupy movement is split into three camps. One is run by the Casu&rsquo;s Our Party and another, next door, by the Moscow-favored Socialists.</p><p>A further camp two hundred metres away, outside the Moldovan Government, is run by pro-European civic activists Dignity and Truth (DA).</p><p>Dressed casually in a black North Face jacket, blue jeans and spectacles, American-educated&nbsp;Casu is fiercely friendly&nbsp;- like&nbsp;a lively Ohio geography teacher on a field trip.</p><p>He leads me to a former USSR army supply vehicle transformed into a kitchen and introduces me to Alina and Tatiana, two strapping ladies in ski jackets, who are stoking a coal-fired oven and cooking up tea in metal buckets painted with giant strawberries.</p><p>&ldquo;Strawberry buckets - that&rsquo;s something!&rdquo; says Casu.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very Soviet,&rdquo; I say.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re Soviet and we love them!&rdquo;</p><p>The tea is weak, sweet and fruity and served in plastic cups.</p><p>Casu says today the tea is not called &ldquo;Che Guevara tea&rdquo;, but &ldquo;Tea Renato Usatii&rdquo; after the party leader, who at that point was receiving treatment in Moscow for a mystery illness.</p><p>I suggest that it would be better to call it &ldquo;Renato Usa-tea&rdquo;.</p><p>But Casu is not impressed with this idea and wants to keep calling it &ldquo;Tea Renato Usatii&rdquo;.</p><p>Our Party launched its camp in mid-September with 100 tents and 100 people sleep&nbsp;over every night, according to the leaders. Casu says his&nbsp;team are &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; who comes in and out of the camp. Drugs and alcohol are forbidden and people only spend a maximum of six days.</p><p>Casu says it is \\\"false\\\" that people stay in his camp for the money. \\\"We don't accept cash from anyone,\\\" he adds.</p><p>&ldquo;We have lots of businessmen who cannot protest as they will have problems with the regime and tax inspection,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They donate wood for the oven, eggs, pasta, rice and&nbsp;meat and we have enough to protest for another year and a half.&rdquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Our Party&rsquo; is the most popular political party in Moldova - capturing 22.8 per cent of the vote, according to a poll in September by the Centre of Sociological Research and CBS Axa.</p><p>Its leader,&nbsp;Usatii, is the most trusted politician in Moldova, states a survey by the&nbsp;International Republican Institute - with a 41 per cent favourable rating. Although 49 per cent view him unfavourably.</p><p>Usatii runs his own charitable foundation, bearing his name, and has paid for free concerts in major Moldovan cities, with massive posters&nbsp;projecting his face&nbsp;from the stage.</p><p>&ldquo;We are a classically anti-system party based on a protest vote,&rdquo; argues Casu. &ldquo;We work on the left, centre and right.&rdquo;</p><p>However many western observers are worried that Usatii is both too close to Moscow in spirit&nbsp;and too close to power in Chisinau.</p><p><img alt=\\\"We demand early elections, Return the (Stolen) billion dollars to the people, Moldova without thieves, read the protest slogans in the Our Party camp outside the Moldovan parliament (photo: Michael Bird)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/IMG_0725.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 1200px; height: 753px;\\\"></p><p>Moldova is hit by&nbsp;a perfect storm of political and economic chaos.</p><p>Prices are rising, wages are falling and the local currency - the Moldovan Lei - is in free fall. For the last decade,&nbsp;Moldova's economy&nbsp;has&nbsp;been dependent on migrant workers sending money back home. But these 'remittances' dropped by 30 per cent this year.</p><p>Citizens are disappointed with the pro-European coalition of four centrist parties, who are haemorrhaging support amid accusations of corruption and malfeasance. The Government resigned in October and has since failed to appoint a stable cabinet.</p><p>Demonstrations&nbsp;in Moldova attract thousands of sympathisers on a daily basis, making Chisinau&nbsp;a city of permanent protest.</p><p>These accelerated recently when energy regulators raised the price of electricity by 37&nbsp;per cent. The police reaction is solid, but calm&nbsp;towards to protesters.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is one example. At a recent demo against tax rises a police riot helmet fell into the&nbsp;crowd.&nbsp;A&nbsp;tall&nbsp;man in his early forties, standing next to me, picked up the helmet.</p><p>He then threw it at a cordon of unarmed cops, hitting the officer in charge in the face.</p><p>The officer replied with&nbsp;\\\"Who threw that?\\\", and shook his finger at the crowd.</p><p>In some countries in this region, the guy who threw the helmet would have, to put it lightly, had the shit kicked out of him.</p><p>There is a narrow&nbsp;line between demonstration and revolution, especially with a hungry and&nbsp;impoverished population with little to lose. Protest leaders seem to realise this - and they reiterate from the podium how they must&nbsp;promote only&nbsp;'peaceful' demos.</p><p>At Government level,&nbsp;European-focused reforms have stalled. The International Monetary Fund has canceled its&nbsp;visits to Moldova. Romania has denied the country its agreed loan of 150 million Euro until it can see concrete reforms from Chisinau.</p><p>The fear is that Moldova is going bankrupt - and no one wants to give it any money.</p><p>Its citizens - who are split in half between those closer to Russia and those to the EU - all blame the pro-European leaders.</p><p>&ldquo;Their actions and behaviour in power were criminal from the start and the west knew this,&rdquo; says Casu. &ldquo;But the west supplied them with financial resources because of geopolitical confrontation with Russia. These idiots would go to Brussels and Washington [and say] &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t give us money, Putin will come with tanks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Although perceived as allied to Moscow, Casu argues that &lsquo;Our Party&rsquo; is not&nbsp;pro-Russian, but&nbsp;pro-Moldovan.</p><p>Nevertheless Usatii himself has been caught on tape bragging about his membership of the Russian Secret Service (FSB) - a statement he later retracted. Casu&nbsp;believes the &ldquo;propaganda machine&rdquo; of a Moldovan media close to the pro-Europeans &ldquo;regards Usatii as a pro-Russian politician and Putin&rsquo;s right hand man.&rdquo;</p><p>He says Moldova is a deeply divided society. &ldquo;We have preferences - pro-Europe, pro-Russia, pro-Turkey, pro-Mozambique, pro-Argentina&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pro-Cuba,&rdquo; I say, gesturing to the tea.</p><p>&ldquo;Pro-Cuba! It&rsquo;s important, but not as important as being a citizen of Moldova.&rdquo;</p><p>Support in Moldova for EU integration has tumbled from nearly 80 per cent in 2007 to 41 per cent last August, according to CBS-AXA/Centre for Sociological Research.</p><p>While those against the union have jumped from less than ten per cent&nbsp;to 36 per cent.</p><p>The popularity of the EU has become collateral damage in the people&rsquo;s fight against a corrupt political system which has sported the label &lsquo;Pro-European&rsquo;.</p><p>In October, Usatii was arrested for tapping private conversations between ex-Prime Minister Vlad Filat and businessman Ilan Shor, two figures allegedly at the centre of the scandal in 2014 that saw one billion dollars vanish from three Moldovan banks through&nbsp;shell companies in the UK.</p><p>The extortion left a hole in the bank&rsquo;s finances of close to 900 million USD, which the state had to fill.</p><p>During the arrest, the Our Party offices were raided by police.</p><p>The detention wasn&rsquo;t legal, says Casu. After three days, Usatii was acquitted and started suffering serious headaches.</p><p>&ldquo;The Moldovan doctors urgently told him to Moscow, to take emergency treatment and tests,&rdquo; says Casu.</p><p>When we speak (in November), Usatii is expecting the results of the medical analysis.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a concern the regime slipped something into the food or water - a substance not made in Ukraine, Moldova or Russia, but from the United States exclusively,&rdquo; says the Our Party executive.</p><p>The suspicion, says Casu, is that the regime locked him up to administer this.</p><p>This would be a strong accusation.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hypothesis,&rdquo; says Casu. &ldquo;It wasn't sugar or honey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something radioactive? Polonium?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sarin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an expert.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big risk for the regime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The regime is desperate and is losing power,&rdquo; says Casu. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worried about being held accountable for the crimes they committed.&rdquo;</p><p>Two weeks later [29 November] Casu tells me Usatii is \\\"recovering\\\" and they have no results yet from the tests.</p><p>Casu does not believe the decision makers in Brussels are seriously considering EU membership for Moldova. Right now in place remains the EU association agreement, which opens an EU vocation for the country.</p><p>&ldquo;When we come to power, in the second day, we would not scrap the EU association agreement,&rdquo; says Casu.</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately there would be a Maidan [a demonstration similar to those in Ukraine in 2014/2015] in downtown Chisinau and we would be compelled to rule with the army and the police,&rdquo; he says, gesturing to the Moldovan Parliament behind us, &ldquo;like they do. That&rsquo;s not governing Moldova, that&rsquo;s protecting your butt from your own citizens.&rdquo;</p><p>Casu has problems with the trade and economic side of the association agreement. For example, he wants Moldovan apple producers&nbsp;to freely sell&nbsp;fruit to&nbsp;Belorussia and Russia.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We will fight for Russian markets for Moldovan apples, because it is in the national interests of Moldova,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The Dutch sells tulips in Russia, the French sell them goat&rsquo;s cheese - we can do the same.&rdquo;</p><p>Casu wants to &ldquo;sit down and renegotiate the trade aspects of the deal&rdquo;.</p><p>Meanwhile more Moldovans than ever now believe that their&nbsp;economy can better develop under a Customs&rsquo; Union with Russia and ex-USSR countries than with the EU.</p><p>But this enthusiasm is slight, with a percentage point difference of 42 to 41 per cent of the population, according to CBS-AXA, revealing a sharp polarization.</p><p>Asked whether Our Party supports the Russian Customs&rsquo; Union, Casu says he wants to launch a referendum on foreign policy, where citizens choose between the EU, custom&rsquo;s union or neutrality&nbsp;- for which only a qualified majority verdict will be respected.</p><p>I am sceptical about Usatii&rsquo;s party&rsquo;s intentions - but Oleg Brega, an anti-system activist, who deplores nearly all political parties, later tells me: &ldquo;I do not think even Usatii will go against EU integration.&rdquo;</p><p>As I walk through the camp with Casu, the slogans on the tents reveal: &ldquo;Renato Usatii - we are together with you&rdquo;. Another tent is covered in a&nbsp;polystyrene structure, emblazoned with the name &lsquo;Soroca&rsquo; - the title of a castle in north Moldova. In the camp, there is a small canteen where people eat, drink 'Tea Renato Usatii', play chess and cards. Around a dozen pensioners are feasting on&nbsp;fat German-style sausages.</p><p>Casu shows me his tent - a green one-man capsule of canvass with a sleeping bag and bedding. Five megaphones are on the floor amid scattered pieces of polystyrene.</p><p>He sits down and I take his photo.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Muhammad Gaddafi,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Although the tent protest is now small, thousands join a Dignity and Truth demo on 29 November, outside the Government building (photo: Michael Bird) \\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/chisinau.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 1280px; height: 853px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">CAMP NUMBER TWO</div><p>Pensioner Oleg Kaminsky, 67, stands in front of Chisinau&rsquo;s Triumphal Arch, built in 1840 to commemorate Russia&rsquo;s victory over Turkey, on the Square of the Great National Assembly.</p><p>A soft-spoken former construction engineer, he has camped out for two months since September, joining many retirees, activists and Afghan war veterans, as part of the civic platform Dignity and Truth (DA), who have made the central square a home.</p><p>&ldquo;My beard has grown,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Kaminsky is angry at the low living standards and allegations that Moldovan politicians have used intermediaries to siphon off cash from&nbsp;electricity deals with&nbsp;the country&rsquo;s breakaway republic of Transnistria.</p><p>&ldquo;Our government has been in permanent corruption,&rdquo; he says.

June 13 2015. Tbilisi, Georgia.&nbsp;</p><p>The rain starts to fall.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a sweltering day and the sudden precipitation brings relief to 20 year-old programmer Beqa Gozalishvili.</p><p>Sitting with an open window in the 23-storey Tbilisi City Hall, Gozalishvili prefers the cool of winters and hopes fresh air will now descend on the city.</p><p>He has joined his colleagues at the weekend to meet a deadline. Gozalishvili is one of the youngest employees in the municipal office.</p><p>Now he&nbsp;is&nbsp;typing. As usual, his monitor is turned off. His colleagues are playing computer games. The deadline is met. There is nothing more to do. But they can&rsquo;t leave - because the rain continues at a greater volume. With greater intensity.</p><p>Rushing into the office comes their head of their IT department, Irakli. He tells them the City Hall needs to build&nbsp;an App that will allow Georgians to donate money and supplies to disaster victims.</p><p>Tbilisi&rsquo;s Vere River has broken its banks. Twitter suddenly lights up with messages detailing the horrors. People have drowned.</p><p>The city&rsquo;s zoo, at the foot of the steep valley in which Tbilisi lies, had been struck by the massive flow of water. Its fences are broken and the animals are escaping.</p><p>Tigers, wolves and hippos are roaming through the streets, fleeing the deluge. And the people need help and information fast.</p><p>Beqa knows he will have to spend the whole night at the office. He calls his mother, Inga.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he tells her.</p><p>&ldquo;How can I not worry?&rdquo; asks his mother.</p><p>&ldquo;This place is not dangerous. We&rsquo;re on the 14th floor.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Inga says ok. She has long learned to stop worrying about what could happen to Beqa.&nbsp;</p><p>She trusts him so much that she sometimes forgets he is blind.</p><p>Next day at noon the app is ready and the office closes.&nbsp;The water has subsided. Beqa normally takes the shuttle-bus, but now his colleagues drive him home.&nbsp;</p><p>Beqa arrives at 2pm and his four-year old brother Andria runs towards him.</p><p>Inga has spent the whole night awake watching the news and thinking about her eldest son.

He did not know he was blind until he was seven, when he heard a woman saying that he could not see.&nbsp;</p><p>It was not a shock, because he lacked the concepts of light, darkness and blindness. His parents hadn&rsquo;t explained the situation to him, so&nbsp;he wouldn&rsquo;t feel different from other kids.&nbsp;</p><p>For Beqa, listening is his most acute sense.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I hear a person even if she or he doesn't talk,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There is some sound coming back from this person. I can hear if there is a wall or a car parked near me.&rdquo;</p><p>People blind from birth make use of the visual parts of their brain to refine the sensation of sound and touch, according to a study by the Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC).&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We can see that in the blind, large parts of the visual cortex light up when participants are engaged in auditory and tactile tasks,&rdquo; says the study&rsquo;s lead investigator, Josef P. Rauschecker, professor in the university&rsquo;s Department of Physiology and Biophysics. &ldquo;This is in addition to the areas in their brain that are dedicated to processing sound and touch.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>At the Special School for the Blind in Tbilisi, where Beqa studied until the 12th grade, he first heard about the white cane complex. Parents preferred to shadow their blind children everywhere instead of letting them use the cane on the streets, because people would notice they were blind. Even in schools, parents waited in a room for their kids to finish classes.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like blind people,&rdquo; says Beqa. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like people who are dependent on others and don&rsquo;t want to change their life. This is the reason people believe that blind people are stupid and&nbsp;can&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p><p>At 15 Beqa decided to walk unaccompanied to high school. He told his parents there would be a time when they wouldn&rsquo;t be around, and he should face this alone.&nbsp;</p><p>The white cane and GPS help him in most situations, and when they are not enough, he can ask pedestrians.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We are not gods,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and we sometimes have to ask others for help, even if we are blind or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"&ldquo;I hear a person even if she or he doesn't talk,&rdquo;  says Beqa, blind since birth (picture copyright: Andrei Becheru)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/IMG_9291.jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9; width: 1280px; height: 853px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His first computer is now in the hallway, near a shelf built in the wall that hosts coffee cups and china figurines. It&rsquo;s a standard computer, bought in September 2008 when Beqa was in the 7th grade. Firstly, he became accustomed to the keyboard, the operating systems and internet surfing.</p><p>On every keyboard, the f and the j keys have bumps that help him find the other keys. Then he downloaded the first programming books in Russian, and he learned programming languages such as Delfi, C/C++ and Python.</p><p>It took him two years to create the first Georgian speech synthesizer, a voice module which can be integrated into screen readers. It was the&nbsp;idea of his friend, a 33-old blind man, Lado Urdulashvili. Developing a speech synthesizer means creating a large audio library. Beqa prepared 1,300 sentences, while Lado searched for an actor to record them.</p><p>The first software version was ready in February 2014, and Beqa offered it gratis to the Blind Union in Tbilisi, under the condition they would distribute it for free to the blind in Georgia. A few months later, Georgia&rsquo;s Interior Ministry bought the license from Beqa, to use the Georgian speech synthesizer on their website. In summer 2014, he started working at the Ministry of Interior, adapting his own software to their website. He was only 19.</p><p>Last year, Beqa sent his CV to five IT companies without mentioning he was blind. Once invited for interviews, the employers discovered that he was visually impaired, and they all told him: &ldquo;the job is taken&rdquo;.</p><p>The Georgian Labour Code does not forbid discrimination in the workplace for people with disabilities. An inter-ministerial council is now preparing an amendment, which should be voted by the Parliament in 2016, says Elza Jgerenaia, Head of Labour and Employment Policy Department.</p><p>At the beginning of 2015, Beqa read about a job opportunity as a programmer at the Tbilisi City Hall. He applied, went to the interview and heard the same sentence &ldquo;Can you program?&rdquo;. He was accepted for a two-month trial. Finally he won the position, becoming one of 24 people with disabilities who work in Georgia&rsquo;s public institutions - from a workforce of 100,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\\\"\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"720\\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/148729505\\\" title=\\\"A few short steps, but a great distance\\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1280\\\"></iframe></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">USSR: charity in the ghetto</div><p>At school,&nbsp;Beqa heard&nbsp;about the Ponichala district in Tbilisi, where blind people lived and worked in the Soviet period. The settlement was created at the end of the 19th century by Tbilisi philanthropists and included classrooms&nbsp;and a few dormitories.&nbsp;</p><p>The district developed in the 1930s, when the Soviets built a factory and apartments for the blind. The city&rsquo;s entire blind community stayed there. Until the 1970s, there was a physical wall separating the district from the rest of the city.</p><p>&ldquo;It is how our blind people lived, and they still live, behind this invisible wall,&rdquo; says Beqa. &ldquo;But most of the time, they build this wall inside them.&rdquo;</p><p>This wall existed for him as well. &ldquo;But time is passing and the wall is shrinking for me,&rdquo; he adds.</p><p>Georgia was part of the USSR until independence in 1991. During this period, the state created social policies for people with disabilities, such as giving them a pension. The number of hospitals and institutions for people with a handicap increased, and special schools were created. The state took pride in its protection of invalids, but one consequence for people with disabilities&nbsp;was segregation and a lack of independence.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the 1970s, a group of Russian activists in the USSR, including Yuri Kisselev and Valery Fefelov, campaigned for the rights of persons with disabilities to have a job. Instead of being recipients of a social pension and living in institutions, they could be productive members of society.</p><p>In a book published in 1986, Fefelov told the story of a Western journalist who approached a Russian official during the Olympic Games in Moscow in 1980. He asked him if the USSR would take part in the first Paralympic Games due to take place at the end of that year in Great Britain.&nbsp;</p><p>The Soviet official replied: &ldquo;There are no invalids in USSR!&rdquo;</p><p>It became the title of Fefelov&rsquo;s book.</p><p>But integration happened slowly. By 2005, when Georgia made the first steps to inclusive education, and kids with special needs went to public schools, the other children&rsquo;s parents protested. They were afraid that disability could spread like the flu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Disabled access slalom on underground steps, Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi (picture copyright: Andrei Becheru)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/IMG_0142.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 1280px; height: 853px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Tinatin: excelling in hospitality&nbsp;</div><p>The happiest day in the life of Tinatin Kuskusela was when she started working as a waitress at the Tbilisi Marriott Hotel, on 10 May 2002. She was 21 and was close to graduation.&nbsp;</p><p>She loved every part of the hotel and the hallway covered in beige wallpaper with a floral pattern reminded her of the lush Edwardian interiors of the Titanic.</p><p>But this changed in September 2009. Tinatin&nbsp;was in a car accident. It was a rainy evening and she was driving home from work. She recalls only the face of a policeman asking for her ID, before she fell unconscious.</p><p>When she opened her eyes and understood she was in a hospital, her first thought was that she was supposed to work the morning shift, and nobody had told her boss.</p><p>Following&nbsp;surgery,&nbsp;Tinatin figured out by herself that she would no longer be able to walk.</p><p>Her friends and colleagues supported her. The hotel&rsquo;s general manager said she would receive her salary during her recovery.</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t depressed that I would be in a wheelchair,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was ready to go out into the world and return to work. The real tragedy was when I realized I would be dependent on my family for everything. For two years, I was a house plant.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>One day she saw a TV show with Rati Ionatamishvili, a man in wheelchair who danced. Rati works at Tbilisi City Hall. He takes part in dancing contests and writes poetry. Tinatin friended him on Facebook and Rati introduced her to the sporting world. She met people in the Paralympic movement and this encouraged her to leave her sedentary life.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I got so enthused when I saw people in wheelchair playing rugby and weight-lifting. Their power came from inside.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Two years after the accident, Tinatin&nbsp;returned to the Marriott where she received a new position: food and beverage assistant. She now supervises the hotel&rsquo;s cafe and restaurant.&nbsp;</p><p>But there are unpleasant moments. One time a customer was unhappy with the service and asked to talk to the boss.&nbsp;</p><p>Tinatin showed up in the wheelchair, introduced herself and asked the customer what was wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>The man was taken aback.&nbsp;</p><p>He insisted that he wanted to talk to &ldquo;the real boss&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Duelling wheelchairs: fencing champions Irma Khetsuriani and Temo Dadiani (picture copyright: Andrei Becheru)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/IMG_0553.jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9; width: 1280px; height: 853px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Fighting for empowerment</div><p>The taxi, a shabby Nissan Murano with a scratched windscreen, pulls up in front of the Marriott. The 60-year old driver seems confused when he sees the woman in a wheelchair.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t know what to do, but Tinatin muddles through without him and uses her strength to wrestle&nbsp;into the seat next to the driver. She is sometimes ashamed of her well-muscled arms, and even has problems finding suitable clothes.&nbsp;</p><p>Taxi and cars are the only available transport for people in a wheelchair in Tbilisi. The public transport system is not accessible, and drivers almost never stop at zebra crossings. On the main avenues, the only way to cross the street are underground walkways or foot bridges. Some walkways have ramps, but the slopes are too steep.&nbsp;</p><p>The City Hall installed them a few years ago to show that it had done something for the people with disabilities, but &ldquo;they are just for show&rdquo;, says Tamuna Nadiradze, project manager for Coalition for Independent Living.</p><p>Tinatin is heading to the Paralympic center, where she is training with twin brothers, Tornike and Tsotne, who both use a&nbsp;wheelchair. She is teaching them an indoor ball game called Boccia. Tinatin explains the rules and the twins are a bit shy, but listen to her with curiosity. It&rsquo;s almost 7pm.</p><p>&ldquo;You first throw the white ball in midfield, then each team must throw the red and blue balls closest to the white one,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>The third kid who had to come to the training is missing, so Tinatin&rsquo;s best friend Irma Khetsuriani keeps his place during the game. Irma is an international fencing champion, whom Tinatin met in a rehabilitation center in Ukraine.</p><p>A refugee from Abkhazia, she has remained in a wheelchair after suffering spine cancer. In a few days she will take part in the national fencing contest for the Paralympics.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Dancing to the same tune</div><p>It&rsquo;s evening in Tbilisi&rsquo;s Mravaljamieri restaurant. Irma and her friend Qristina rush toward the dance floor. A few hours before, Irma won the women's fencing finals, but lost the last game to Temo Dadiani, winner of the men&rsquo;s final and&nbsp;a veteran of the Afghan war.&nbsp;</p><p>She is now the only one in a wheelchair among a group dancing to a mix of international hits, Georgian music and Soviet songs.&nbsp;</p><p>Irma loves to dance, but the other customers&nbsp; are staring at her, so much so, that sometimes she feels she is making a protest. But she wants to show the others that people in a wheelchair can enjoy life just like anybody else. Then a 30-something stranger stops dancing, gives her a long look and kisses her on the forehead.&nbsp;</p><p>Tinatin is also there - but she initially remains at the table. Later they are seated together.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make a toast,&rdquo; Tinatin says. &ldquo;For love and life, because as long as you love, it means you&rsquo;re alive. And for Georgia, a small country that is still surviving.&rdquo;</p><p>Almost every time they go out, people send food or drinks to their table. Some even offer to pay for their surgery in the United States. No one calls the next day to keep the promise.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;People are amazed that we smile, go out and dance,&rdquo; says Irma.&nbsp;</p><p>Tinatin replies that she is sometimes tired of being an example for others and just wants to enjoy a Saturday evening without receiving so much attention. Such charity tends to be from people who only become generous after a few vodkas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Manufacturing accessibility: Giorgi Grigolaia in the wheelchair workshop (picture copyright: Andrei Becheru)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/IMG_9564.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 1280px; height: 853px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Giorgi: manufacturing accessibility</div><p>A small and white mix-breed nudges up close to Giorgi Grigolaia&rsquo;s wheelchair and keeps pining for food, while the 51-year old man tries to eat undisturbed. He looks from time to time to his colleagues who are playing backgammon.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s not in the mood to join them today. During the lunch break, the workshop where these men manufacture wheelchairs is silent, except for the sound of dice rolling, laughter&nbsp;and the barking of the hungry dog.&nbsp;</p><p>On 18 May 1993, during the Abkhaz war, when the coastal region of Georgia declared its independence from Tbilisi, a mine exploded near Giorgi, causing him a spine injury. He says that he went&nbsp;to war because it was his duty and doesn&rsquo;t regret it - although he ended up in a wheelchair and Georgia lost Abkhazia.</p><p>For almost 20 years, Giorgi did not earn any money, except for his veteran pension, and was dependent on his family. He worked as a coach in children camps, where he taught the kids how to move in wheelchair. He played basketball with the Paralympics, but he didn&rsquo;t have a proper job. He did not even try to search for one, because he thought that no one would hire a man in a wheelchair..&nbsp;</p><p>In 2010, he heard that the Coalition for&nbsp;Independent Living NGO, where he was a volunteer, was about to open a workshop that produces wheelchairs. Giorgi applied for a job and was accepted.</p><p>The workshop, in the outskirts of Tbilisi, was created five years ago through a program financed by the United States Development Agency USAID and implemented by the Coalition for&nbsp;Independent Living.</p><p>More than half of the employees working in the workshop in Tbilisi are in wheelchairs. The financing ended one year ago, but the project is self-sustaining.</p><p>After being injured, Giorgi felt that his self-confidence was shattered not only by not being able to move, but mainly because he couldn&rsquo;t bring any money to his family. &ldquo;I took the subway only once, and I don&rsquo;t want to repeat the experience again.\\\"&nbsp; He tried to go down the escalator, but couldn&rsquo;t control his wheelchair, which spun into the air and fell down on top of him.</p><p>In the workshop, Giorgi mans the cutter. He is slicing tubes of different lengths, which is the first step to producing wheelchairs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I overdo my job and cut everything!&rdquo; he laughs. Life has changed a lot for Giorgi after he started working here because the war veteran can support himself and can spend time with his colleagues, who are also his friends. &ldquo;This job is very important, because it helps me be independent.&rdquo;</p><p>37 year-old Gela Laghidze, also working in the workshop, could not walk from the age of three, so learned to adapt fast.</p><p>Gela understood early that he needs to make a living, and to choose something that doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of physical effort, so he focused on electronics. He learned to repair watches, phones and&nbsp;TVs when still a kid.</p><p>In the underground metro, he also saw that people in a wheelchair could not go down the escalators easily. So he dismounted, crawled down onto the steps and pulled the wheelchair behind him. He saw people's shock at first but he noticed that &ldquo;if you stick to your routine each day, people get used to you&rdquo;.</p><p>In a country like Georgia, where the state&rsquo;s measures are too weak to produce significant changes for persons with disabilities, Gela learned that if you want to live independent you need to become the hero of your own life.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When you are determined and motivated to be independent, you find the strength in you to overcome all the difficulties,&rdquo;&nbsp;says the technician.</p><p>Gela&nbsp;returns&nbsp;to his colleagues rolling the dice against the backgammon board.</p><p>It&rsquo;s time for a last game - and then back to work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>The grant for this project is from &ldquo;Investing in quality journalism on international development- a sustainable approach to raising public awareness of development cooperation and global issues&rdquo; under the European Development Year 2015 by The Romanian Centre for European Policies (CRPE) in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme - Regional Centre for Europe and Central Asia.</em></p><p><em>The is part of Romania&rsquo;s national working plan for the European Development Year 2015 (AED2015), financed by the European Commission and Romania&rsquo;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

They made us sign something, but we couldn&rsquo;t see what we were signing. They put cash in our hands but we didn&rsquo;t know how much, and then pushed us out and back onto the bus. We only got to count the money once we got home.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This is how Coman parted with her farmland in 2006. When she returned&nbsp;home, she counted the money; it came to 400 lei (about 90 Euro) for a hectare of land. Six years later, a subsidiary belonging to Rabobank bought Coman&rsquo;s land for upwards of 2,000 Euro per hectare.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Since 2012, Rabobank has bought at least 939 hectares of land in Dobromir, the vast majority of which they lease out to the village mayor, Eugen Iliescu.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the plains of east&nbsp;Romania where&nbsp;Dobromir lies, the bank has&nbsp;purchased another 17,000 hectares. Through a farmland investment fund called Rabo Farm, the Rabobank has invested 315 million Euro&nbsp;in farmland, with the intention of selling after 10-15 years at a profit of up to 900 million Euro.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Land \\\"to triple in value\\\" over next decade, locals live on \\\"50 Euro per month\\\"</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Rabobank chose east Romania because&nbsp;the soil is rich. Heavy in humus with&nbsp;deep black colour, it is known as&nbsp;chernozem &ndash; or black earth in a Russian phrase&nbsp;&ndash; and is so prized for its fertility that in Ukraine, where the law prevents foreigners from buying land, each year 900 million USD worth of the dirt&nbsp;is&nbsp;shovelled into trucks and illegally trafficked across the border.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Also there is the price. Currently valued at between 2,000 Euro and 3,500 Euro per hectare for foreign investors, agricultural land here is a fraction of the price of land in western Europe, and is expected to triple in value over the next decade.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Not that this means much to the villagers of Dobromir. The village, Mayor Iliescu tells me, is the poorest in Constanta County &ndash; which would put it in line for the poorest in&nbsp;Romania. Some 70 per cent&nbsp;of residents depend almost entirely on public assistance of a&nbsp;mere 50 Euro a month. They&nbsp;supplement this welfare&nbsp;with food grown on small plots of land and, often, money sent back by family members working&nbsp;abroad. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">So when a demand for land started to grow in the years running up to Romania&rsquo;s accession to the European Union in 2007, many villagers were keen to sell. Often they needed the money for something immediate &ndash; villagers I talked to tell me how they sold their land to pay for a wedding, to travel abroad to work, or to support a sick relative.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But few wanted to sell their land in the way that was forced upon them. Through dozens of interviews and the analysis of hundreds of land registry documents, we have found that almost all the land Rabobank bought in Dobromir and the neighbouring villages was acquired by a group of three intermediaries.&nbsp;These intermediaries, in turn, employed a group of local heavyweights to gather the land, led by&nbsp;Gheorghe Papuc.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Papers for land \\\"signed in the dark\\\"</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Papuc&rsquo;s name is on everyone&rsquo;s lips in Dobromir. They know him as a close associate of the former mayor of the village, Iusein Visel, who was voted out of office in 2012. Last year, an investigation was launched into them&nbsp;by the National Anti-Corruption Directorate on charges that they had worked together to steal over 200,000 Euro&nbsp;in agricultural subsidies from the state. And they know him as a scout, gathering land for what the villagers refer to again and again as a &lsquo;mafia&rsquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ramona Constantin is a pensioner who sold five hectares of land to Papuc, after her uncle died and left her the land. Documents&nbsp;suggest that part of this land was then sold on to Rabo Farm. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"[Papuc] and his men got names from Visel of all the older people who have land. Then they targeted us,\\\" says Constantin.&nbsp;\\\"They stood outside our doors at night and shouted for us, for hours if necessary, until we came out.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">After this, her story mirrors that of Coman and many other villagers I speak to: all were taken by bus to Constanta to meet the notary, where they signed papers in the dark and were handed a bundle of notes in return &ndash; never worth more than 100 Euro per hectare. No one I speak to knows to whom their land was sold. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Papuc&rsquo;s name is nowhere to be found on any land registry documents relating to Rabobank. The documents show that the bank&rsquo;s subsidiary Kamparo Investment bought land in Dobromir and the surrounding villages from three intermediaries: Stefan Babos Parcalab, Gabriel Ovidiu Stefanescu, and Marius Octav Moronescu.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Our evidence suggests that Kamparo had an exclusivity contract with these intermediaries, ensuring that in this area Kamparo would buy only from them or companies with whom they&nbsp;worked. When we asked Dick van den Oever, Managing Director of Rabo Farm, if this was the case, he said: \\\"I do not know by heart what kind of agreement we have with specific intermediaries, but in principle I would say that if I had an agreement with someone who is acting in an area, I would prefer to work with him on an exclusivity basis.\\\"</p><p>If we are to believe the land registry documents, Babos, Stefanescu, and Moronescu bought the land they sold to Kamparo directly from villagers, starting in 2005 and continuing through to 2014. But these documents don&rsquo;t tell the whole story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"They ripped me off - then&nbsp;turned against me\\\"</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Situated behind a makeshift chicken wire fence on the side of a busy road, Papuc&rsquo;s office doesn&rsquo;t look like the workplace of a mafioso. A cardboard sign on the gate advertises firewood for sale. Inside, a shabby bungalow looks like it was built in a hurry. As I approach, a heavyset man hurries out the door and up to the gate, where he introduces himself as &lsquo;the guard&rsquo;. Shortly after, Papuc arrives with his wife. Built like a boxer and with a twitch that intermittently interrupts his speech, Papuc is happy to talk about his business. He explains how he has worked extensively for Stefanescu, Babos, and Moronescu over the years, putting together a team of scouts to gather them a total of 1,700 hectares of land in Dobromir and the surrounding villages.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For this, he was promised payment of 400 lei (about 90 Euro) a hectare &ndash; the same amount villagers in Dobromir report being paid for the land itself. But Papuc says he was never paid the full amount. \\\"They ripped me off,\\\" he says. \\\"Then I couldn&rsquo;t pay my men, so they turned against me.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Land registry documents show that Kamparo Investment also bought hundreds of hectares in Dobromir and surrounding villages from a company called Retail Development Services, who also used Stefanescu, Babos, and Moronescu as exclusive intermediaries. Retail Development Services held the land for three to five years before selling to Kamparo Investments.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Business registry documents show that Retail Development Services has gone to great lengths to conceal its owners. The company&rsquo;s sole shareholder is listed as Spalato Company Ltd, which is registered to a postal address in Cyprus. Spalato in turn is owned by Vane Investment Corp and Tegor Holdings, which are registered in Liberia &ndash; one of seven countries worldwide blacklisted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as &lsquo;uncooperative tax havens&rsquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">With the help of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, we got in touch with leading Liberian investigative journalist Rodney Sieh and asked him to try and find out who was behind Vane Investment Corp and Tegor Holdings. <span style=\\\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\\\">The companies, he found, had been </span>set up&nbsp;with the help of&nbsp;a <span style=\\\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\\\">lawyer and acted as shells</span>, with all funds channelled offshore once again, to an unnamed tax jurisdiction. No names &ndash; not even that of the lawyer &ndash; were listed in association with the companies.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But Romanian land registry documents give one important name as a representative of Retail Development Services &ndash; Menachem Metzger.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><span style=\\\"color: rgb(116, 192, 226); font-weight: bold;\\\">The Israeli business connection</span></div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Metzger is an Israeli businessman who court records show to have a long history of illegal land deals behind him. Our research suggests he first appeared in Romania in 2003, just months after he had run into trouble in Israel for filing for bankruptcy with over three million Euro of unpaid debts, causing the Israeli Authorities to confiscate his assets and freeze his passport. Now, his name can be found as administrator of&nbsp;a number of Romanian companies, worth a combined total of over half a billion euros. All but one of these companies are registered at a single PO box in Cyprus and at least one has reportedly come under investigation by the National Anti-Corruption Directorate&nbsp;in Romania on suspicion of money laundering.</p><p>Since becoming mayor of Dobromir three years ago, Eugen Iliescu has made friends and enemies in equal measure. Many people here say that he has begun to free the village from the mafia that had formed around the former mayor, Visel. An old man called Petrica Oriviceanu tells me how Iliescu helped him get his land back after it was illegally taken and sold to Kamparo Investment in 2012. Iliescu found out what had happened, informed Oriviceanu and then paid for a lawyer to take Kamparo and the other parties involved to court. In a matter of weeks Oriviceanu had his land back.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But others are less certain. Iliescu now controls almost everything in Dobromir &ndash; including 882 hectares of the land owned by Rabo Farm. On top of this, he farms another 2,300 hectares &ndash; much of which is said to have come directly from his father, who ran the local collectivized farm under the communist rule of Ceausescu. He tells me how everything he produces he sells to Cargill, the American agricultural giant, who sells it onwards: \\\"Wheat to Egypt, rapeseed to Holland and barley to the United Arab Emirates.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We meet, at his request, in a neighbouring village, at a small and&nbsp;badly-lit bar. Apart from a young woman playing on her phone behind the bar, it is&nbsp;empty, and remains so for the full two hours I am there.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">I ask him why Kamparo Investment bought through intermediaries, rather than sending their own people to Dobromir. \\\"They didn't have time to run around after documents, to look for sellers and deal with all the hassle,\\\" he says. \\\"They had guys who did all this for them, and it suited Kamparo as it was easier. And it meant they were always clean. Even Stefanescu and Babos make sure they kept their collars clean&nbsp;&ndash; they employed Papuc to acquire the land for them and kept their heads turned while he was doing it.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Rabobank: \\\"we will use new info to review our relationships\\\"</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We put the complaints of Dobromir villagers to Rabobank. They responded: \\\"The Due Diligence Process for land acquisitions foresees a check on sellers and intermediaries. These processes have led in a number of cases to the cancellation of cooperation with intermediaries. We take the allegations seriously. We will use any new information to review our business relationships and terminate should your allegations prove to be correct.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For the moment, Rabobank&rsquo;s intermediaries are still hard at work in Dobromir. When I last visited the village this summer, Mayor Iliescu told me that Stefanescu and his lawyer had been there that week, &lsquo;with a briefcase full of money&rsquo;, signing new ownership papers for land obtained by Papuc and his men.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Before I leave the village, a young woman who has lived and worked in Dobromir all her adult life - and who requested to remain anonymous for this article - walks me up to Iliescu&rsquo;s farm complex. Built on the site of the old collective farm, it now looks shiny and efficient. Brand new John Deere tractors sit outside vast corrugated steel warehouses, while a sole figure shifts hay bales with a fork lift. It could well be in France&nbsp;or Holland.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"Iliescu has created a presentable image with this, but it&rsquo;s built on our backs,\\\"&nbsp;she says. \\\"Since the time when Romania became part of the European Union, almost all the villagers here have sold their land or had it taken from them. Now they regret it terribly. They have nothing to their name. It means they can be bought for almost nothing by anyone who wants to be mayor. It is a pity, but this is how our local politicians understood democracy.\\\"</p><div style=\\\"color: rgb(33, 33, 33); font-family: wf_segoe-ui_normal, 'Segoe UI', 'Segoe WP', Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\\\"color: rgb(33, 33, 33); font-family: wf_segoe-ui_normal, 'Segoe UI', 'Segoe WP', Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>Some names have been changed to protect&nbsp;identities.&nbsp;</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>Thanks to Milvus Wildlife Protection Group, Attila Szocs, Stefan Candea, Andreea Pavel, Manuela Boghian, and Elena from Dobromir.</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>This investigative journalism project was made possible in part by the Robert Bosch Stiftung and&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://journalismfund.eu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">JournalismFund.eu</a></em></div></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"4216ebe0-0491-4b30-b98e-704f8c93f119\"}]"}, "pk": 1223, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

This medication regulated his life, helped him hold down a job and broke his link to a&nbsp;lifestyle of injecting narcotics and stimulants up to 15 times per day.</p><p>But when the Russians seized the peninsular in March 2014, the new leaders&nbsp;banned the supply of OST opiates methadone and buprenorphine.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with over 800 other Crimean clients of OST, Ivan was faced with three choices: leave, detox or risk&nbsp;relapsing into crime and fatal addiction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">The hook: Painkillers</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ivan did not choose to be&nbsp;an addict. It started when he was 15 years of age in 2001. After a serious bike accident&nbsp;left his leg injured, the doctors tanked him up on narcotic-like pain reliever Tramadol.</p><p>When he left the hospital, the doctors handed the teenager ten packs of Tramadol, which he shared with his friends.</p><p>&ldquo;After the accident I realized I wanted to live - I drank and had parties and enjoyed life to the full,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>But he wanted to quit&nbsp;Tramadol. Soon he was injecting a home-made stimulant called Vint - a meth-like brew&nbsp;using the ephedrine extracted from cold&nbsp;relief tablets.</p><p>&ldquo;Users advised me to get off Tramadol by getting high on Vint,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>He lost half a year to lack of sleep and food, and memory loss. During this time, he&nbsp;did not wash and&nbsp;slept on the street.</p><p>Then Ivan tried shirka - a &lsquo;village heroin&rsquo; synthesised from the powdered heads of a Ukraine-grown poppy. He would inject at home, in the countryside, under bridges and in bus shelters.</p><p>After he shot an artery with Vint, he felt a tingle, then a spasm and collapsed. It was a stroke. The right side of his body was partially paralyzed, and the pupil of one of his eyes fell to the side.&nbsp;</p><p>But he did not stop. Now he took anything to relieve the pain, a cocktail of drugs which gave the effect of feeling as though, as he said:&nbsp;&ldquo;I was moving on the earth, but also swimming in the sea.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2008 he heard about the availability of OST in the Crimean capital of Simferopol. He entered the local clinic, walked straight into the room of the chief narcologist, and told him:&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I am told you are a very kind man, please help me, or I will die.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Escaping&nbsp;to society&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013, there were 21,100 injecting drug users in the Crimean peninsular from a population of 2.3 million, according to the NGO Alliance for Public Health (Kyiv).</p><p>OST was legal in Crimea from 2006. Eight locations in the major towns and cities of the Ukrainian region offered users a chance to withdraw from illegal drugs by replacing them with legal opiates.</p><p>There were 806 patients on OST. These centres also gave counselling and medical tests, and were a vital link between an underground culture and public health.&nbsp;</p><p>Here users talked, played chess, socialised, celebrated birthdays - even met&nbsp;lovers, married and had kids.</p><p>But they also took drugs to suppress the effects of HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis, diseases prevalent among drug users in the ex-Soviet states.</p><p>OST gave them a daily routine and connected them to society through a regime which reduced their chances of using hard drugs, sharing needles or contracting HIV.&nbsp;</p><p>This option is recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations (UN) as an instrument in a toolbox of services to help users quit.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Comprehensive harm reduction strategies, which include opioid substitution therapy, are essential to prevent and treat HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis among people who inject drugs everywhere, including in Crimea,&rdquo; the Secretary General Special Envoy on HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Michel Kazatchkine tell us.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Harm reduction strategies give people who inject drugs the best chance of leading a healthy and productive life and will help to reverse the rising number of new HIV infections across eastern Europe.\\\"&nbsp;</p><p>Ivan&rsquo;s course of buprenorphine took him from under the bridges and out of the bus shelters. Soon he was working as a cargo handler in the nearby port, before finding a job in his chosen&nbsp;profession -&nbsp;a sound technician.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Russia: fast&nbsp;shutdown</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But in a near-bloodless coup in March 2014, the Russians seized Crimea. Moscow was reacting to what it perceived as western-backed interference in Ukraine&rsquo;s democracy. After the fall of the Kremlin-favoured President Victor Yanukovich, Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s forces and sympathisers annexed Crimea, a region which had been traditionally more pro-Russian and which hosts Russia&rsquo;s Black Sea fleet.</p><p>Russia had banned opiate substitution treatment since 1998 and the new authorities In Crimea gave all the drug providers less than a month to close operations.</p><p>In April 2014, the head of Russia&rsquo;s Federal Drug Control Service, Victor Ivanov, visited Crimea to impose the new policy.&nbsp;</p><p>He framed OST as part of a corrupt western attempt to infiltrate Russia&rsquo;s right to decide its own health policy. In a speech, he denounced the NGOs involved in the organization of OST supply of &ldquo;representing the interests of western pharmaceutical companies.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Ivanov trashed&nbsp;the members of&nbsp;civil society members&nbsp;complaining about the OST shutdown, claiming they were &ldquo;provoking anti-Russian protests among consumers of Methadone and their relatives&rdquo; because the NGOs&nbsp;feared&nbsp;losing foreign financing.&nbsp;</p><p>The drug that had regulated Ivan&rsquo;s life vanished.</p><p>Users were scared that a sudden break in their regime could kill them. They also wanted to show the new leadership that their choice of using OST was not part of a political game to discredit Russian health policy. &nbsp;</p><p>In May 2014, Crimean drug activist Igor Kouzmenko <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8gF7SgPbjk\\\">filmed drug users imploring Russia </a>to allow them to continue their OST regime.</p><p>Ten users braved public exposure to state their case for a humane intervention by Moscow. These included a former &lsquo;liquidator&rsquo; who helped clean up radioactive waste from nuclear power station Chernobyl, invalids, pensioners and parents of teenage boys, many of whom were suffering from HIV, TB and Hepatitis.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple, sitting in a park with a newborn baby playing in their laps, pleaded: &ldquo;If we close the program, the happiness we built up over several years will be broken down.&rdquo;</p><p>Each of the users spoke to the camera without anger or despair, stating:</p><p>&ldquo;Please do not let us die.&rdquo;</p><p>Kouzmenko&rsquo;s video ended with the words: &ldquo;They do not talk about politics. They do not ask for much. They just want to live.&rdquo;</p><p>But the authorities did not allow the programme to continue.</p><p>The users had three options: revert to street drugs, flee to mainland Ukraine to continue therapy or detox in Russia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Every option but methadone</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Russia&rsquo;s state-run rehabilitation centres, the medical field sees addiction as a psychiatric issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Medicines given to patients include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neuroleptics and anti-psychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, used in the past to treat schizophrenia.</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the USSR employed&nbsp;similar drugs against dissidents as part of a &ldquo;repressive psychiatry&rdquo; programme to silence internal opposition and frame critics of the Soviet Union as mentally defective.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Now they are using the same drugs to treat addicts,&rdquo; says Anya Sarang, president of the Russia-based NGO, the Andrei Rylkov Foundation.</p><p>In Russia, there are also private rehabilitation centres which can use &ldquo;approved&rdquo; methods to treat drug users.</p><p>These patented techniques include prayer,&nbsp;hitting a patient&rsquo;s head with a bolt of lightning, electrodes in the ears, shock treatment, telling the patient to imagine entering God&rsquo;s Temple and swearing to give up drugs, charms to be spoken on Tuesdays and Thursdays for men and Wednesdays and Fridays for women, heating the body to 43 degrees celsius, inducing a coma, and implanting <a href=\\\"http://en.rylkov-fond.org/blog/arf-advocacy/arf-international-advocacy/atmospheric-pressure/\\\">the fetal brain tissue from a guinea pig below the patient&rsquo;s cranium to reduce the side effects of treatment and abstinence</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Flogging, burying a patient for 15 minutes and spanking therapy are&nbsp;also on offer for addicts. Used as a cure against alcoholism, depression and obesity, a healer smashes a fistful of thick and heavy branches against a patient&rsquo;s back <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6GqN4N2vII\\\">until the skin bruises.</a></p><p>These methods are all available to addicts, but methadone is banned.</p><p>&ldquo;The rehabilitation and abstinence-based approach is viewed and presented in Russia as an alternative - or in opposition - to substitution treatment,&rdquo; says Anya Sarang. &ldquo;But shouldn&rsquo;t there be many options for [users] to get what they want? To see what would be most helpful for them?&rdquo;</p><p>Russia is experiencing a massive rise in HIV infections. The Russian Federal AIDS Centre estimates that Russia now&nbsp;registers over one million infections. Of greater concern is the centre&rsquo;s prediction that this could double in two years to two million. From this figure, 60 per cent are injecting drug users.&nbsp;</p><p>However the real numbers of HIV carriers could be between one and four million people from a population of 146.5 million. Therefore Russia risks crossing from hosting a &lsquo;concentrated&rsquo; to a &lsquo;generalized&rsquo; epidemic.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The lack of substitution treatment is one of the reasons why Russia has not been able to control the HIV epidemic,&rdquo; says Sarang. &nbsp;</p><p>Drug users with HIV are more likely to adhere to a regime of anti-retrovirals if they receive OST treatment for their addiction at the same time - and ideally at the same place.</p><p>Also worrying is Tuberculosis, which is on the rise in Russia and is the main cause of death among people with HIV.</p><p>Recent research by the Andrei Rylkov Foundation found that, from 13 Russian TB hospitals, the rate of drug dependent patients who dropped out of treatment veered between 70 and 100 per cent.</p><p>Over 120,000 are also in prison in Russia due to drug-related crime - a massive increase since 2005. Jails themselves become not only a school for crime, but a hotbed of addiction and disease.</p><p>&ldquo;There are a whole bunch of issues which could be solved if we had this simple intervention [of OST],&rdquo; says Sarang. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really cheap and cost-effective. If we had that, we could solve all the problems in the medical, law enforcement and criminal fields.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Since the Russian annexation in 2014, home-made sedative Krokodil is now the drug of choice in Crimea, says local users (Picture: Georgian Krokodil user, by Michael Bird)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Krokodil.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 500px; height: 750px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">A way out: suicide and overdose</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the video of Crimean drug users is Anton, in his late 30s, dressed in a hoodie with a wan and pockmarked face and a leg disabled from injecting home-made drugs.</p><p>When the Russians took over, Anton went to a rehab clinic in Saint Petersburg.

Anton reverted to using street drugs.

But this was only a pause.</p><p>Now Crimea is a closed country, with little access to either the Russian or Ukrainian mainland. Heroin and marijuana, for example, are unavailable, although some legal highs such as synthetic cannabinoid &ldquo;Spice&rdquo; have appeared.&nbsp;</p><p>Because pharmacies also lack supplies, addicts cannot buy medicine to manufacture into stimulants.</p><p>But this has failed to&nbsp;stop&nbsp;problem drug use.&nbsp;</p><p>Since mid-2014, dealers switched from selling &lsquo;Cheka&rsquo; to krokodil - a form of desomorphine usually extracted from codeine-based pharmacy drugs.

But there is no official data on the total public land owned by foreigners. Estimates range between ten and 40 per cent of Romanian agricultural land controlled by foreign companies or individuals. Many are attracted by the EU farm subsidies.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"This trend is growing faster,&rdquo; one land broker for foreigners tells us.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Often local intermediaries deal with village bureaucracy and negotiate with peasants, before selling the land on to investment funds, or agribusinesses, who merge them into mega-farms.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Since the revolution, land consolidation benefited from high-level support in Romania.

At the same time, he fought against the &lsquo;chiaburimea&rsquo; or rich peasant &lsquo;Kulak&rsquo; class, accused of exploiting the poor peasantry. In the next period the seizures of &lsquo;chiaburi&rsquo; wealth and the arrests began.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In 1951, the Party deported the &lsquo;chiaburi&rsquo; to the almost deserted plains in the south-east of the country, the Baragan.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The exiled also included landowners, foreigners, alleged German army collaborators, people with relatives abroad, enemies of socialism, and political or criminal prisoners.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">With the deportation of citizens from the regions near the Yugoslavian border, Dej wanted to prevent possible influence from the Yugoslav dictator Marshall Tito on this multiethnic region and limit the resistance against collectivization.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Not so many chiaburi lived in Dudestii Vechi, so the Communist authorities had to invent them.

Platoons of soldiers arrived in the village.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;On Sunday, in front of the church, the town crier of the village, Ioan Mirciov, beat the drum with the following unusual announcement: &lsquo;We inform everyone that for the next five days nobody is allowed to go out on the field, because the army will carry out shooting exercises,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mirciov wrote.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">That night, armed militiamen and soldiers went to the gates and asked people for their ID. In two hours, everyone in the house had to be present at the train station - 87 families, 443 people altogether. They were given no explanation.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Caradjov&rsquo;s relatives were among them.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They had less than seven hectares of land. He was six years old at the time.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"They took my great-grandfather and my great-grandmother. And they told my father he could stay. My father never wanted to leave, but I wanted to leave, so my father said: &lsquo;We're coming with you!&rsquo;. We didn&rsquo;t know where they&rsquo;re taking us.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They were allowed to take a cart with their belongings to the station, so they piled up a bed, a mattress, a few trays, a bedsheet, a pillow, and a whole ham. But some people didn&rsquo;t have any food to bring.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">As the Kalcsov family was preparing to leave, some neighbors opened the gate to their house, seized a pig and stole some wine.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Communists soon confiscated their remaining belongings. The party found a use for everything.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When the convoy marched to the station, many villagers pulled down their shutters and sat in the dark, peeping out at the deportees from between the blinds.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The villagers piled up their belongings, including cows and horses, and themselves into freight cars. Once the trains were set in motion, the officers told them they were going 600 km to the Baragan. It sounded as alien as the Russian steppe.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The train would stop at times, and the children received tea and marmalade from the Red Cross. The women would milk the cows in the wagons and feed the children. The journey lasted a week.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/il5.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 1100px; height: 658px;\\\"></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They arrived at a hill near the high bank of the Borcea, an offshoot from the Danube, where the wind and the heat were fierce.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The settlement was named the Valea Viilor (Vineyards Valley), but there were no valley or vineyards.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Nor were there houses. There was only a large field, and 250 square metre lots, marked by stakes in the ground.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">On the first day a storm came, and the exiles hid under their tables, and inside their wardrobes. Overnight, a sheepdog stole took the piece of ham Caradjov had brought from home.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the beginning, the deportees drank water from the river, ditches and from puddles made by the hoof-prints of their horses.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the nearest village, every house had a well, but the locals didn&rsquo;t to give the newcomers water at first, as the villagers believed they were criminals, traitors, or kulaks.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/baragn.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 1100px; height: 658px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But soon they began to build their own agriculture and industry. Every day, a little man called Ion borrowed a horse to dig a well 60 metres deep using a pulley and wheel system.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The water we drew was full of clay,&rdquo; Caradjov says, &ldquo;and they were putting it in pots, leaving it to rest, before they would drink.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Some made their huts in the ground, which they covered with thatch-straw. Others started to cut down trees and cut sheaves of wheat to make their huts. Slowly, the deportees began to build houses.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">One of them knew masonry, another carpentry, and another was a butcher. Soon they were allowed to work in the farms and gardens of the local collective. They baked bread in ovens dug in the ground, because the earth in the Baragan is thick and strong. They prepared the dough at night and during the day baked five kilograms of bread at once. The locals from Baragan hadn&rsquo;t seen such bread before, and soon warmed to the exiles.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"These newcomers were some kind of outbreak of civilization,\\\" says Gheorghe Kalcsov, born in the Baragan, in 1953.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But the oldest could not forget their home. They needed a purpose in Baragan - and that was their land left in Dudestii Vechi. Ioan Petcov, over 80 years old, left almost 100 hectares, writes Rafael Mirciov in his book:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"In the Baragan, another villager, Ghita, a kin of his, begged Petcov for a hectare from his vast wealth, in return for help and assistance&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Petcov refused the proposal, because he wanted to work his land when he returned.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">However - meanwhile in Dudestii Vechi, the new socialist system confiscated the land and created state farms (IAS) or forced peasants to collectivize their plots in Agricultural Production Cooperatives (CAP).</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The difference between the two was that in the cooperatives, the villagers would theoretically keep the right to their property.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Engineer Dancu Vasilcin&rsquo;s grandfather entered&nbsp;the cooperative.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"You could in theory exit the CAP, but, in practice, no one was allowed to get out,\\\" says Vasilcin.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Until 1989, 411 IAS and 3,776 CAP operated in Romania. Officially, collectivisation was based on the willingness of farmers to work their land together.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In Dudestii Vechi, deportation was the best way to \\\"convince\\\" those left in Banat to give up their land.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"[Deportation] was the biggest step toward collectivization. When they [deportees] left, almost half of the village land became state property,\\\" explains Gheorghe Ghergulov.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The rest knew that - one way or another - they would lose their plots.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Party representatives later admitted that they made mistakes. A document from 1952, at the National Archives, shows: \\\"some organs of the Party and the People's Councils in these regions, applying mechanically the rules for identifying the 'chiaburi' households, wrongly placed peasant households in the category.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Responsible for those mistakes were the \\\"hostile elements,\\\" reads the document. At Dudestii Vechi, the \\\"hostile elements\\\" included people from the village.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">At the beginning of 1956, the Communists put the villagers in the Baragan into wagons and sent them back home.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When they all returned to Banat, the 80-year old Petcov turned up at the village with a scythe in hand, ready to work his 100 hectares - but the land had gone.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Some villagers even had to go to the court to take back their homes.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/collectivisation.jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9; width: 1100px;\\\"></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But as Romania industrialised, factories started opening in neighbouring towns of Sannicolau Mare and Timisoara, and many young people would break away from agriculture. Life in the city had new attractions.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A little revolution</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Communism fell in 1989, with the execution of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu on Christmas Day.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the spring of 1990, Stoian Caradjov started his own little Revolution.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He remembered where his family&rsquo;s land-plot has been, near the railroad track, where it was now part of a state farm.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Everyone else knew this place. During Communism, the plot was called \\\"At the Gardener&rsquo;s\\\" after the family nickname.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Caradjov took a tractor from the state farm and went to till his plots. Many villagers confronted this sturdy man, going rogue with a tractor.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; one of his neighbors asked.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see, I&rsquo;m ploughing!&rdquo; he said.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;What do you mean you&rsquo;re ploughing?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Whose land is this?&rdquo; said Caradjov. &ldquo;Come here and I will show you!&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They couldn&rsquo;t pull him off the tractor because he was burly and strong. Even now, in his 70s, his arms are as wide as shovels. He ploughed alone. Others, like Dancu Vasilcin, followed his example.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In 1991, the democratic state&rsquo;s new Land Law did something that not even the Communists dared - to take over the land from the cooperatives that the peasants still owned on paper.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Then the officials gave each family between 0.5 and 10 hectares, with the democratic Romanian state taking over the rest.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This tore up the cooperative agreement, which said that when the farms would be</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">disbanded, each peasant could take his land.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"My grandfather joined the CAP,&rdquo; says Vasilcin. &ldquo;My father was also in the CAP. (...) Our parents knew where our own plots were.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This created disputes as land has switched from peasant, to cooperative and back to a different peasant.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Then a new law in 2000, <a href=\\\"http://www.cdep.ro/pls/legis/legis_pck.htp_act_text?idt=21873\\\">the Lupu Law</a> overturned this law. This allowed the people of Dudesti to claim back the exact land they had lost during Communism.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But these plots had already been shared to former collectivist workers and to deportees, so the local committee members decided to share only the leftover plots, often far from the village - and on weaker land, including pasture - which was useless for anyone but a cow or a sheep.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The recipients of this land received only a certificate with the surface area - not the boundaries.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This lack of detail created confusion.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Gheorghe Kalcsov was entitled to two hectares of his plot, but this had already been shared to another peasant.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The village hall proposed to give him equivalent land surface, but this was far from his home.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A lawyer at the village hall convinced him to sell on the spot the right to these two hectares of land.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;He gave me money, and who knows what he did with it,&rdquo; says Kalcsov, &ldquo;but I never saw that land.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Whenever the villagers wanted to sell their land, the village hall would process the documents without delay. This is how the process of consolidation was taking place.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Meanwhile the machinery and infrastructure from the collective farms was stolen or destroyed.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"The accountants and the economists began sharing the equipment,&rdquo; says Gheorghe Kalcsov. &ldquo;One would steal a tractor, another was stealing a drill, or a plough. And if a farmer, like me, wanted to plough or work on his plot, he would be at their mercy. All the poor people took sheep, cows, horses from the cooperative farms. In a year they ate all the animals. Then they began to destroy the stables for bricks or wood, to cut down the trees in the fields. It was chaos!\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">'You cannot be the same farmer after 50 years'</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But people were happy to have their land back and regain control over their lives. It was a symbol of their dignity, American anthropologist Katherine Verdery writes in \\\"The Vanishing Hectare,\\\" a book about the land restitution in a Romanian village in the &lsquo;90s.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ghergulov was still working at the village hall in the early 90s, and he was trying to temper the enthusiasm of the seniors who used to work the land before Communism.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">If they were in their 20s when they remained landless, now they were in their 70s. Ghergulov once asked an old man:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;What do you think you can do with the land? You're not the same. 50 years have passed.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">And he was enraged.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Why do you care?&rdquo; he told Ghergulov. &ldquo;Give me the land! I worked it, I can do it!&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They really tried.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A common vision in Romanian villages today is to see a peasant with a horse and a cart on a country road. But this was not a regular occurrence in the Communist era. This is something that began again in the 1990s.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Pensioners who lost their land in the 1950s bought horses and carts to work their land, taking up farming the manner which they had left it.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"It was the same as when they were children,&rdquo; says Kalcsov. &ldquo;They thought they could turn history around. Many fell ill and died of a heart attack on their field.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Those under 40, like him, struggled to work on their ten hectares. But they had no access to markets to sell their products, no subsidies and had to borrow cash.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">And when they had the money, they couldn&rsquo;t find an available tractor driver to plough or sow. Even if they could borrow such a vehicle, it would often break down.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/grim%20reaper.jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9; width: 1100px;\\\"></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ghergulov&rsquo;s parents were still alive after the Revolution; and they took back their piece of land. They were ploughing corn with the help of some Roma neighbors, who had a donkey.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">His mother was supervising the Roma, and Ghergulov would help after finishing work at the village hall.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A scene is stuck in his mind, which he says was the epitome of shame.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"I was looking at our own land, where my great-grandfather, who was the boss, let us enter only barefoot when the soil was soft. Now there were some kids: one was pulling a donkey, and the other one was pushing the animal, to try and force it to work. If the old man would have risen from the grave, he would have said we were crazy.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;That was the tragedy: people were enthusiastic and they would have worked. They tried. some of them died on the field. Because they making an effort at something they could no longer do. Even this year, someone passing-by some farmland saw an 80 year-old man lying down in his field, and thought he was resting. When he went up to him, he was dead.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The state did not help with any subsidies.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"Such demands ran counter to the plans of international organizations to reduce the power of postsocialist states and convinced policy-makers that these populations were prisoners of a socialist mentality,&rdquo; writes Katherine Verdery. &ldquo;As it happened, however, village farmers understood the situation very clearly: if the state did not help them as the states of Western Europe helped their own farmers, these villagers could not succeed.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">After a while, Ghergulov began to hear more often phrases such as \\\"I want to sell the land&rdquo;. In Dudestii Vechi elders were dying or becoming powerless.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The younger villagers wanted a western lifestyle, second-hand BMWs, modern appliances, TVs and double-glazed windows.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the early 2000s, when the Italians came, prices were at about 200 Deutschmarks per hectare, which meant about 100 Euro in today's money. They bought up.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Many who had no historical connection to their land sold first.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Those who had land - which was historically their property - rarely sold,&rdquo; says Cardjanov. &ldquo;When the elders died, they heirs were in cities like Timisoara and Arad, they didn&rsquo;t live here. Then they sold the land.&rdquo; Most of the former deportees kept their land.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">One of Kalcsov&rsquo;s neighbors had five or six hectares.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"He worked it in the early days, but after that, he sold the land, and bought two cars.

In the early 2000s, he remembers that people in Dudestii Vechi were &ldquo;kind&rdquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Italians first bought the remains of the state Farm and started renting plots from owners. \\\"And once we had rented, slowly people sold,\\\" he says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">It was more profitable in the short-term for them to sell 20 hectares of land in Dudesti and buy an apartment in the city \\\"than to keep it here, where they have no income,\\\" says Rocchi&rsquo;s successor, Sebastiano Stoppa.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We are passing through Dudestii Vechi in Stoppa&rsquo;s SUV, as he shows me the Italian&rsquo;s land.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"My boss paid for each hectare from his pocket,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;He had no help. He dreamed of having the most modern and most beautiful farm in Europe.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">On both sides of road there are irrigation canals with fresh cement and beyond&nbsp;the land is levelled. A long and intricate sprinkler system on huge wheels is poised for work.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Italians collected as many ownership certificates as they could. But there were still gaps in the land which belonged to smallholders.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Stoppa is sensitive about criticism of the Italian company&rsquo;s actions in the zone. In his defence, he compares what they have done in Dudestii Vechi with the work of an artist. In this comparison, he says the land around the village was like a pile of dead leaves.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"If a Frenchman comes and takes the fallen leaves, and with those leaves he makes a beautiful painting and sells it, you can be sure that someone will come to say 'he stole our leaves!&rsquo;.

His family had about ten hectares of land in one place.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Kalcsov claims that the Italians moved the poles - which demarcated the boundary of their land and his - a few metres onto his plot, pushing his space into adjacent empty land, which he argues is of an inferior quality.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He could not afford to hire a lawyer and argues this strategy is meant to make landowners sell up and quit.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Stoian Caradjov has a piece of land between two lots belonging to the Italians. When they pass by with their big equipment and vehicles, they drive over his land. When they have used herbicides, it has spread on his land and destroyed his harvest. One year, he lost half of his sunflower production.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Italians compensated him with money, but the fact that they did this on purpose bothers him.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"They want you to leave them alone,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they want. They want to occupy everything. Well, that&rsquo;s not possible.

In 2013, only a few roads over the big slices of land of the company are evident, and there are only a few traces of the old roads.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The mayor of Dudestii Vechi, Gheorghe Nacov, says that Emiliana has obtained approvals from Timis County Council for those works, but no one consulted the locals. Nacov now says he is working on \\\"regulating the situation\\\" and if it doesn&rsquo;t work in a peaceful manner, they will go to court.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">No room for the village</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Today's agriculture is an industry, and there is no room left for the village. In his guest room with chairs covered in ragged leather, with a large wall clock with the sound of a cathedral belltower, under a light that seems to belong to another century, priest Ioan Vasilcin says that there is something he cannot understand: today, when so many machines are helping and everything is done so easily, it should be better for the people, but it is not.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He remembers that in his childhood, peasants used to work the land with hoes and animals, and they still had time to get together and talk to each other:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"On 1 November, each host would be done with the agriculture and they would gather together and kill the pigs. And now we are all running about and do not have time to talk. Why is that? We ought to have more time. People should be able to leave work and say: 'I am done, now I am free'. But now there's nobody on the street.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In Dudestii Vechi, the rhythm of the day is the one of factories, not of agriculture. Many young people are working 13 kilometres in Sannicolau Mare, and the village is a dormitory settlement for another town.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Each morning and evening, the buses paid by industrial companies stop at the station in the center and drive their staff to the factories.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"If there were would be no factories in Sannicolau Mare, Dudestii Vechi would starve, it would disappear,\\\" Dan Ciobotaru, an archeologist at the Museum of Banat, tells me.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Kalcsov takes me on a tour around his garden. In the middle there is a mini-reservoir made from plastic water bottles. Last summer he kept water lilies there. Wooden stakes hold up tomato vines, and he grows celery and carrots. He is taking care of a few grapevines. Some of the branches died, but he supplemented them with some muscadine from Oltenia, a black variety of grape. Pots are hanging from the branches. For two months he mulled brandy, which he sold, and received some money. Two 150-pound pigs snuffle the ground nearby. Chickens prance around the barn. Later, he will clean up the entire garden and in spring he will start again. He has ten hectares of land, in four separate places. He is working one, and has leased the rest. \\\"I&rsquo;m not at the disposal of anyone,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I do it all myself. Should I grumble?\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Now most of the people have sold their plots of land. And for those who are retired or without a job, they depend one way or another on the village hall.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/header2.jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9; width: 1300px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The village has a town crier who beats a drum to make public announcements.</p><p>Iosif \\\"Vinti\\\" Ianculov lives on welfare in a row of houses near the cemetery. He used to work as a guard at the village hall, and has been through four mayors, as he says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But in 2013, the village hall fired him and hired a security company instead.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">If they had kept him on for two years and three months more on any kind of odd job, he could have retired.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"But they didn&rsquo;t want to keep me because they said I'm not one of them,\\\" he says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He had a hectare and 11 acres from his father and one hectare from his mother, but he sold them in 2006 or 2007 for 400 Euro.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In order to receive unemployment benefit, Vinti has to work for four days a month for the village hall, as a sort of handyman. Every time they call, he puts on a military cap, beats the drum and calls out to people in the street the local news and small ads.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">It is November 2015. The phone rings: the village hall asks him to announce that tonight at 5:30 there is a rally to commemorate the people who died in a night-club fire in Bucharest.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"They will give me a paper with what I have to say,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I do not know what to say myself.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When he is walking through the village with his drum, Vinti hears a number of complaints about the mayor. People would sometimes pick on him for what the mayor does or doesn&rsquo;t do.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"They complain about the roads, about the bridges,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but the mayor cannot do everything at once.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The current mayor, Gheorghe Nacov, was re-elected in 2012 with 1,347 votes. In a village shrinking by the day, where the land is evaporating, he gains votes from public works. These include building a floodlit stadium, named after Bulgarian footballing hero and Barcelona alumni Hristo Stoichkov, and paying for buses to take the faithful to monasteries.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"This village works by employing as many people as possible,&rdquo; says Ivan Vasilchin, artist and local activist. &ldquo;If you give two lei to someone, he is already yours. And all his family would vote for you because you gave him a crumb of bread.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Without land, the power of the mayor increases. And this creates a chain of poverty from which it&rsquo;s really difficult to get out.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Vinti reads out the small ads. Commercials for selling land are now few and far between. Most of the land has been sold. Last year there was one announcement.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He asked if any villagers wanted to sell their land.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He beat his drum once, twice and then a third time - but nobody came.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">However there are many houses for sale in Dudesti.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But Vinti can keep shouting and beating the drum to see who wants to buy a house. No one does.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">There are empty houses for everybody.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>This article was produced during a Milena Jesenska Visiting Fellowship sponsored by <a href=\\\"http://www.iwm.at\\\">the Institute for Human Sciences</a>, Vienna&nbsp;and <a href=\\\"http://www.erstestiftung.org/\\\">Erste Foundation</a>, Vienna, between October and December 2015.</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"46a03054-5773-46c0-a744-6b01578b2c39\"}]"}, "pk": 1229, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

The Firearms Directive was the result, focused mostly on free trade in the domestic market.&nbsp;</p><p>Back then blank firing arms - also known as alarm weapons - were not even covered by the legislation, because they were not considered firearms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On <a href=\\\"https://via.hypothes.is/eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32008L0051&amp;from=en\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">21 May 2008 the European&nbsp;Commission</a> announced the imposing of tougher regulation on weapons in all member states.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal: if gun nuts wanted to hang a Kalashnikov in their living room as a conversation piece, then the weapon should be unable to be reactivated with live ammunition.</p><p>For these types of weapons, according to the 2008/51/EC Directive, the EU wanted stricter technical standards.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The Commission will enact joint directives for deactivation standards and techniques, to make sure that deactivated firearms are made unusable for good,&rdquo; it stated. &nbsp;</p><p>But two things were missing. First - a deadline for when the EU plans to impose such standards in all member states.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, alarm weapons - such as those employed in the Paris shootings - were missing from the directive.</p><p>These weapons are used on film sets, in parades or even by people who want to pose as Rambo on their Facebook profile. For the EU, this category was a security blind spot.&nbsp;</p><p>They were not firearms because they did not fire bullets, but were not deactivated weapons, because they could still go &lsquo;bang&rsquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">No action on &lsquo;alarm weapons&rsquo; fears</div><p><a href=\\\"https://hyp.is/AVPsqX7XH9ZO4OKSlmNN/hoover.snow.grep.ro/_collections/public-lvd388ydl9qzXFzUVrvL/files/replica_guns_52010DC0404_EN_TXT.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">In 2010, the European Commission drew up a report</a> noting that policy experts, invited by MEPs, had explained the potentially criminal use of alarm guns, which could be converted into deadly&nbsp;firearms.</p><p>The document stated that&nbsp;&ldquo;reported cases&rdquo; of these guns and replicas &ldquo;with ill intent to intimidate or stage hold-ups&rdquo; must be seen &ldquo;in the context of the relatively high number&rdquo; of alarm guns - and other non-lethal weapons like airsoft guns - in the European Union.&nbsp;</p><p>The Commission was concerned with maintaining its principle&nbsp;of the free movement of goods within Europe, as arms production and trade constitute a massive and legitimate European business.</p><p>The report stated that &ldquo;national rules governing&rdquo; the marketing and use of replicas, of which it included alarm weapons in several references, &ldquo;must respect the principle of the free movement of goods (Articles 34 to 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU).&rdquo;</p><p>Article 34 prohibits national measures which can or could, directly or indirectly, impede intra-community trade.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus regulations by one Member State prohibiting the import, manufacture, sale or use of replica firearms could &ldquo;constitute a barrier to trade within the meaning of Article 34. &rdquo;</p><p>The same document mentions experts&rsquo; concerns about the re-activation and lethal use of such weapons. The narrative works like this: a Communist-era weapon is &lsquo;deactivated&rsquo; by a gunsmith and converted into an alarm gun.</p><p>It can then be bought and sold on in an open and&nbsp;unregulated market within the EU (although not in every country).</p><p>This is a way for the gun to become &lsquo;legit&rsquo;, before it enters the criminal underworld and can be reconverted into a deadly weapon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Slovak warning ignored</div><p>Concerned by this phenomenon, in September 2013 Slovakia sent out an alert to all European police authorities, in English, about how easy alarm weapons can be transformed into killing machines.&nbsp;</p><p>Slovakia was a country with relaxed regulations on turning firearms into blank-firing weapons. The Slovak police were worried, so published a poster with 16 photos.</p><p>This detailed how blank-firing weapons can be reactivated using slight changes: such as removing two steel rods which blocked the barrel. It was easy to buy such a weapon in any arms shop - the only condition was to be over 18 and to show an ID.&nbsp;</p><p>The police poster was showing a pistol that was turned into a blank-firing weapon by a Slovakian gunsmith company called Kol Arms and an assault rifle Ceska VZ 58. Both were later reactivated illegally.&nbsp;</p><p>These and other expert views were heard in Brussels. In October 2013 a report by the Commission said: police experts are signalling that alarm weapons are &ldquo;illegally transformed into deadly firearms&rdquo;. The Commission added that they are aware of &ldquo;very important differences in deactivation standards&rdquo; from one member state to another.&nbsp;</p><p>It was also aware of killings using&nbsp;with such weapons. After it was evaluated, at the end of 2014, Brussels missed one point: deactivation standards are applied only to firearms that are made totally unusable.&nbsp;</p><p>So again this did not apply to blank-firing weapons. Therefore the Slovak alert was ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>What is not clear is whether there was an intention to open this loophole.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href=\\\"https://via.hypothes.is/webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:6Ae_R_0DKHoJ:ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm%3Fdo%3DgroupDetail.groupDetailDoc%26id%3D17681+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=de\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">May 2014 there was a meeting of EU experts</a> on the arms black market.

One was de-activated into a blank-firing weapon in 2013 by Kol Arms, the other a year later.&nbsp;This weapon has the serial number 63622.&nbsp;</p><p>Both weapons were sold as blank-firing weapons in 2014 over the counter to anyone older then 18, before being re-activated by an underworld gunsmith.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a ballistics expert from the Paris police, the reactivation process with such weapons is easy, because it involves only re-engineering the barrel.</p><p>Such weapons are available online and through the post. The extra short weapon costs about 500 Euro, the longer version between 230 to 280 Euro.&nbsp;</p><p>More expensive are both the Tokarev pistols TT 33, which Coulibaly was also carrying. These date back to 1951 and 1952 - and were also turned into blank-firing weapons by Kol Arms in 2014, before being re-activated by a third party.&nbsp;</p><p>This type of Tokarev was spotted in the Marseille region in October 2012 and in Paris in July 2014. Coulibaly had four more pieces at his hideout at Gentilly.&nbsp;</p><p>How Coulibaly assembles this arsenal leads to a shop in Slovakia and an episode of bungling by the French police force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Trafficking departure: Slovak website</div><p>The shop AFG Security is located in the Slovak town of Partizanske, two hours east of Vienna. The store is in a basement of a two-storey apartment building, next to a railway. A Der Spiegel reporter was free to browse, but the owner&rsquo;s sister said the store refused to answer questions from journalists. All other requests for information were denied.</p><p>From this basement, AFG had been supplying criminals throughout Europe with blank-firing weapons. The arms ended up with gangsters in the UK, a Neo-Nazi in Germany and Islamic terrorists in France.</p><p>The weapons are sold &ldquo;for fun&rdquo;, argues AFG on its website, such as restaging battles from the second world war. It also states that these are: &ldquo;original weapons, with insignificant changes.&rdquo;</p><p>These &lsquo;scrap&rsquo; weapons come from Slovakian state warehouses, the police and the military. Following the break-up of the Communist bloc, Slovakia started to sell thousands of weapons to companies such as Kol Arms, who turned murderous arms into toys.&nbsp;</p><p>When the weapons left Kol Arms, they were harmless - from a legal point of view. But for criminals, these were the new shit on the market.&nbsp;</p><p>14,000 such weapons were sold by AFG abroad, mostly online, according to the German federal police, who know of 33 investigations into German clients.&nbsp;</p><p>A simple process can convert them back into lethal arms.</p><p>French investigators believe a mid-experienced gunsmith needs only two hours to reactive such a weapon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Arms clients:&nbsp;far-right&nbsp;and criminal underworld</div><p>Protagonists linked to the&nbsp;conversion of over-the-counter products from AFG into deadly weapons faced conviction, before the shop was connected&nbsp;to a chain of sellers which led to the Paris terror attacks.</p><p>In 2014, AFG began to be of interest to authorities in Germany and the UK.</p><p>A starting point was a parcel from Germany, destined for a British gangster Alexander M., aka Smokey, a robber from London who now serves a life sentence. The parcel contained the submachine guns type VZ61, known as Skorpion. Smokey ordered the guns from prison, using his smartphone.</p><p>The authorities only had a pseudonym for the German intermediary who trafficked the weapons - the name Max Mustermann - on a dark net commercial website called Agora. Comments on the site &lsquo;reviewing&rsquo; Mustermann read: &ldquo;My first choice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Max is the best&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>The British and German police sent cyber-investigators to buy such weapons. The tracking numbers of emails led to the Bavarian town of Schweinfurt, and to a 20 year-old student Christoph K. In January 2015 the cops raided his campus flat and other arrests were made in Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>Christoph K. was re-activating weapons bought from AFG in his basement and selling them on at a profit of ten times. He received four years and three months in jail.&nbsp;</p><p>He was not the only dedicated customer of AFG. In the company records, obtained by German police&nbsp;BKA, was also 39 year-old Alexander R., who bought two Kalashnikovs and several Skorpions.&nbsp;</p><p>In Ferlach, called the &ldquo;heart of Austria&rsquo;s arms industry&rdquo; he obtained raw tubes for new barrels to make the weapons active. Alexander R. was known for doing arms business in a Neo-Nazi network connected to the banned far-right Hoffmann Armed Sports Group - Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann.</p><p>The police arrested Alexander R, and discovered his weapons arsenal. He was convicted to four years behind bars. From prison he wrote to his comrades that his goal was to destroy the German Federal Republic and to kill the informants who snitched on him.</p><p>Since his release, Alexander R. has been buying&nbsp;weapons from AFG. Because he thought the police would have the online shop and its transactions under surveillance, he ordered over the counter and paid in cash. He was convicted again - and failed with his request for appeal on most of the points. Dozens of sub-machine guns he purchased have not yet been found.&nbsp;</p><p>Once this route for guns had been established in the criminal and extreme right&nbsp;underworld, it saw exploitation by terrorists connected to fundamentalist Islam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">From Neo-Nazis to ISIS</div><p>In 2014, AFG serves a man from north France over the internet - Claude Hermant -&nbsp;a former member of National Front with a paramilitary background. Hermant had spent time in prison in the Congo after taking part in a failed putsch.&nbsp;</p><p>The ex-paramilitary operated a survival-shop close to Lille. Using his company, he bought from AFG an assortment of pistols, submachine guns and Kalashnikovs VZ 58, all de-activated by Kol Arms.&nbsp;</p><p>After the Paris terror attacks in January 2015, police raided his workshop and found weapons, all reactivated either by drills or by replacing the barrel.</p><p>These included a 15 Ceska VZ 58, a Tokarev TT 33 and ammunition.&nbsp;</p><p>But police did not need to search for a second VZ 58&nbsp;or a further Tokarev TT 33 that Herman had ordered from AFG.&nbsp;</p><p>The VZ 58 was the gun used at kosher supermarket Hyper Cacher to kill 20 year-old student Yohan Cohen. Two Tokarev&nbsp;pistols were also at the crime scene, and four others at Coulibaly&rsquo;s hideout in Gentilly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Not your average arms dealer</div><p>But Hermant had an excuse. The story he told investigators was that, since 2014, he had been buying weapons with the knowledge of the French Gendarmerie, to document an arms dealing ring.&nbsp;</p><p>Hermant sold arms to Samir L., an underworld figure from Roubaix, and he asked his police contacts if they would let him to sell more weapons to the dodgy figure. They agreed.</p><p>The police have acknowledged that Harmant had an official &ldquo;informant&rdquo; status starting from&nbsp;2013. When the police officer in charge of overseeing Harmant was confronted about a failure to see where the guns were ending up, he stated: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running 30 informants, it&rsquo;s complicated.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Another of Hermant&rsquo;s clients was a Belgian, Patrick Halluent. He was also on the client list at AFG, where he bought the second Ceska VZ 58, which was used by&nbsp;the terrorist Coulibaly.</p><p>However a piece of the story is missing: how the weapons from Hermant moved from these intermediaries to Coulibaly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe align=\\\"middle\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"500\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"/assets/spiegel/armapEN/index.html\\\"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Balkan bazaar&nbsp;</div><p>On the 23 July 2015 a white Mercedes travels by ferry from the German island of Fehmarn to Lolland, Denmark.&nbsp;The driver is the Bosnian Sanel H. At a routine check on his vehicle at the ferryport of Rodby, investigators discover ten hand grenades and 13 weapons. His car is an arms depot.</p><p>Sanel H. takes it all on himself. He doesn&rsquo;t give information, name accomplices or state what he plans to do with the weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A note found on him mentions the Danish city of Aalborg, a phone number and a name &ndash; but he says he knows nothing about it. Due to further information, the Danish police question him about a former police officer from Bosnia and Sanel admits knowing him, calling the ex-cop &ldquo;an honest man&rdquo;&nbsp;who has nothing to do with arms dealings.&nbsp;</p><p>Three months later, at the German border with Belgium in Aachen: a police commando arrests the &ldquo;honest man&rdquo;. The German police received a tip from Bosnia. The car driven by the ex-cop has 25 hand grenades and four assault rifles under the brand Zastava M 70, the Serbian Kalashnikov.&nbsp;</p><p>The same type of Zastava M70 was used by Kouachi brothers during their attack on Charlie Hebdo in January. Another M70 was found in the Bataclan club after the massacre in November. A further three examples of the same weapon were found in a Seat Leon used as a getaway car by the attackers at the Bataclan.&nbsp;</p><p>All these weapons were not trafficked through the Slovak cycle described above. They were <a href=\\\"https://hoover.snow.grep.ro/_pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fhoover.snow.grep.ro%2F_collections%2Fpublic-lvd388ydl9qzXFzUVrvL%2Ffiles%2FSAS-SR13-Significant-Surpluses.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">active weapons from the Balkans</a>, where Zastava has historically produced four million M70 AKMs - a figure higher than the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p><p>The M70 found at the Bataclan was shipped on 26 May 1981 to Sarajevo, for the local Yugoslavian Territorial Defence Forces, a National Guard that, after the fall of Yugoslavia, became the core of the Bosnian armed forces during the civil war in the 1990s.&nbsp;</p><p>The second Kalashnikov used at the Bataclan may also have come from the Balkans. This was a Chinese Norinco version of a Kalashnikov, with an unknown fabrication date. Such Chinese weapons were standard equipment for the Albanian Armed Forces. And the third Kalashnikov, made in 1985, came from Bulgaria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The EU committee for internal security (COSI) made a note last year related to the Kalashnikov used at Charlie Hebdo, and observed that the weapon may have come from a stockpile in&nbsp;former East Germany.&nbsp;</p><p>The ballistic reports analyzed by EIC do not support this claim and investigators did not publish proof related to this observation, but this would not be surprising.&nbsp;</p><p>A similar former East Germany weapon showed up in Belgium a few years back, the type MPKIS, which originated from the Balkan war, according to Belgian intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Fragile arsenal</div><p>The Bulgarian Kalashnikov used at the Bataclan could have come from Bulgaria directly: like in so many countries of the former Eastern Bloc, Bulgaria has huge piles of inactive firearms.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2008, Bulgaria announced that it had 46,000 small arms in surplus. Its strategy to dispose of the weapons is first to try to sell them - and what cannot be sold should be melted as scrap iron.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile Romania announced it had 1.25 million in surplus, Albania 259,000, Serbia 90,000 and Bosnia and Herzegovina 53,000.&nbsp;</p><p>These are the weapons from state arsenals, which are poorly guarded - and risk burglary. In January 2009, 62 firearms&nbsp;disappeared from a Romanian military depot in Ciorogarla, just outside the capital Bucharest. Among the stolen weapons were submachine guns type AKM-47, TT type training pistols, and Carpati pistols.&nbsp;The investigation revealed that the theft was conducted at least two weeks before its discovery.</p><p>Several Romanian Army officers were sacked - and members of a criminal gang led by former martial arts&nbsp;champion Eugen Preda were arrested. The suspects were later convicted. 35 weapons - which were to be used in drug trafficking in Europe - were discovered in December 2009 and another 15 in January 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>But throughout the region a&nbsp;larger stockpile is likely to be in private hands, and hiding in basements: when Albanians toppled their government in 1997, at least 500,000 weapons were stolen during the riots and more then 1.5 billion rounds of ammunition.&nbsp;</p><p>Today there is a flourishing business selling and buying such weapons, even at flea markets, and they are sent to west Europe using buses and private cars with no verification on their contents. The customs officers stand no chance, while others take bribes, as a TV investigation published by Canal Plus has shown recently.</p><p>These are the methods used by the Bosnians arrested in Denmark last year. According to the German police BKA, they confiscated 264 such weapons from the Balkans during 2014.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Terrorist accomplice: &ldquo;I only had to say what weapons I need&rdquo;</div><p>In August 2015, three months before the attacks at the Bataclan in Paris, Reda H., an informant and accomplice of terrorist mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud, stated to&nbsp;the French intelligence DGSI: &ldquo;[Abaaoud] told me to search for an easy target, like a concert (&hellip;) He doesn&rsquo;t see any problem to get weapons, I only had to say what I need. I think they had access to a supplier network.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>To reduce such threats, is it enough for Europe to destroy the entire stockpile of the Balkan wars?&nbsp;</p><p>No, says former head of firearms department of the Belgian federal police, Pierre-Yves Fi&eacute;vez: &ldquo;Western Europe will soon face weapons coming from Tunisia and Egypt.

They were known as&nbsp;&lsquo;The White Guard&rsquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Many became civil society activists, who still play an active role in the reform of child protection.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Why did&nbsp;doctors take&nbsp;on such a role?&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">During Communism, medically-trained personnel were tasked with raising deserted&nbsp;children in unheated&nbsp;buildings that served as town hospitals. This abandonment was&nbsp;seen as a public health issue.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Twenty-five years later, Guth is presenting the results of the <a href=\\\"http://childprotectionindex.org/\\\">Child Protection Index</a>, an international instrument whose development he dedicated four years to, coordinating the collaboration of 71 child protection experts from nine countries. He has worked on the project together with <a href=\\\"http://childprotectionindex.org/?portfolio=jocelyn-penner-hall\\\">Jocelyn Penner Hall</a>, World Vision&rsquo;s Policy Director.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This has some disturbing information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;One baby abandoned every six hours&rdquo;</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In Romania, the number of children separated from their families in 1997 was in the range of 100,000 for six million kids.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">By the end of 2013, the number hovered around 60,000 for a total population of four million.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Taken together this amounts to a statistically insignificant change, from 1.66 per cent in 1997 to 1.52 per cent in 2013.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">One reason for this is a gap between reforms on paper, and those on the ground.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For instance, between 1997 and 2007, Romania was pressured by the EU integration process to accelerate reforms. Now - according to the Index - Romania scores highest when it comes to public policies and legal framework, but still hosts the greatest number of institutionalised children in the region.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Armenia and Moldavia follow closely behind. At the other end of the spectrum, the Index results show that of all countries surveyed, Kosovo has parents who are least likely to abandon their children.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Meanwhile, in Romania today, a baby is abandoned in a maternity hospital every six hours.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">What does the tiny decrease in infant abandonment say about child protection efforts over the last twenty-five years?</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;This says that one cannot change the mentality of the public by responding to EU pressure alone,&rdquo; says Penner-Hall.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been said that the year Romania joined the European Union marked the burial of [child protection] reform. With no external pressure, nothing remarkable happened. However, I believe that after 2007 smaller, more meaningful things occurred. The worst day ever was the first day of democracy in Romania; it was that day when the public conscience started to blossom.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Guth also believes that the Index can also be seen as an X-ray of regional mentalities.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;For instance, the results prove that in Armenia 97 per cent of disabled children are taken care of by the state, while only three per cent grow in real families,&rdquo; adds Guth.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The Index also shows that in Georgia the exploitation of children through labour is not considered an issue. They think it is normal for some children not to go to school.&rdquo;</p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><img alt=\\\"Patulele, Romania (copyright: Petrut Calinescu)\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/patulele%2C%20romania.jpg\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Romania: number of kids in rural areas going hungry &ldquo;doubled&rdquo;</div><p>Back in the conference hall, Guth cautions that the results he is about to present are not part of a competition.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But he knows that the moment he opens the diagrams comparing the nine countries, the Romanians will look at where the Bulgarians stand, the Albanians will check Serbia&rsquo;s scores and the Armenians will want to know if they have outrun the Georgians.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">According to overall Index country scores, Romania is placed&nbsp;highest, followed by Bulgaria and Serbia. At a continental level, Romania has some of the most efficient child protection legislation. &ldquo;The law is built upon the structure of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,&rdquo; says Guth. &ldquo;In theory, Romania rocks.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But in practice, the Eurostat data shows is that,&nbsp;as of 2013, the child poverty rate in Romania exceeded 48.5 per cent.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A 2014 World Vision report stated that eight from 100 children in Romania face extreme poverty, living on less than 3.5 Euro per day. The same study testifies that one out of eight children in rural areas go to bed hungry.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This percentage doubled between 2012 and 2014.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;There is so much more to do for the children of Romania,&rdquo; says Daniela Buzducea, Executive Director of World Vision Romania. &ldquo;Then again, to see how far you&rsquo;ve come, you need to know where we started from.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Daniela is part of the first &ldquo;free&rdquo; generation of social workers in Romania. Only in 1994 did Post-Communist Romania have its first graduate promotion in this field. Before this moment, this occupation did not exist.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the 90s found Daniela in the homes of some of Romania&rsquo;s most vulnerable children. She was trying, on her own, to prevent the separation of children from their families.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;To me, the Romania of those years is HIV positive children who got infected in hospitals,&rdquo; she recounts.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the late 1980s, thousands of children in Romanian institutions contracted HIV due to blood transfusions from syringes infected with the virus.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The real moment the reform started is encompassed in a scene when I was&nbsp;visiting a young mum with an infected baby,\\\" says Daniela. \\\"She had no form of support whatsoever. She was going through hell. I also had a small baby at home, and apart from visiting this woman just to reassure her that she was not completely alone, there was not much else I could do.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;One day, she was diagnosed with cancer and lost her hair because of the treatment. When I went to see her, on the wall of her house was written the word: &lsquo;AIDS&rsquo;. She had locked herself inside. She could not even take her child to the hospital because people would throw stones at them. In&nbsp;reforming&nbsp;its social protection system, this is the point from which Romania started.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If I had not been there, the kid would have been lost&rdquo;</div><p>Albanian Zini Kore represents the national child rights network &ldquo;All Together Against Child Trafficking&rdquo; (BKTF). For almost twenty years Zini earned respect on the streets of his&nbsp;country's capital Tirana. Not just with the homeless kids, but also with the cops.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;When the Police find a new child on the street, they call me first, to pick him up and only after that do they contact the authorities,&rdquo; says Zini.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Kids know they may not have much in this life, but at least there is someone fighting on their behalf until the end, no matter what kind of end that&nbsp;may be.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Zini never drives. No matter where duty calls, he always crosses town on foot, searching through the labyrinthine streets,&nbsp;scanning for homeless children.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">There was a time when his phone rang incessantly - at day and night. The terrified voice of a street child on the line. No one knows the magical and&nbsp;subterranean paths his phone number travels to reach the kids in the city who need him most. He always grabbed his clothes and left.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Had I not been there the exact moment the Police accosted a child,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the kid would have been lost in the inferno of the correctional institutions. From there, there is no way out.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Today, his phone rings less often. Thanks in part to Zini and his organisation, who work hard to compensate for the state&rsquo;s lack of involvement, the lives of street children have improved. But the underlying problems persist. The Child Protection Index shows that only Bosnia surpasses Albania when it comes to neglecting the situation of street children. It also demonstrates that the region&nbsp;has a major problem&nbsp;regarding the involvement of authorities in&nbsp;effective protection solutions.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When asked about his kids, Zini proudly mentions his boy, who is still not legally his son. He will soon turn 18 and then Zini will start the adoption procedures. It&rsquo;s easier this way because at this age the young man can make his own decisions. He is&nbsp;one of those street children Zini fought for.</p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><img alt=\\\"Rast, Romania (copyright: Petrut Calinescu)\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/rast%2C%20romania.jpg\\\"></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Child Protection &ldquo;Mall&rdquo; in Sofia</div><p><a href=\\\"http://www.childpact.org/about-us/steering-committee/\\\">George</a> &ldquo;Joro&rdquo; Bogdanov doesn&rsquo;t talk much and when he does he fishes for the right words in English.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He is not a born public speaker. But he is a man of big ideas. He succeeded in&nbsp;putting child protection on the public agenda with an annual gala event where The National Network for Children in Bulgaria recognize citizens whose&nbsp;work improved Bulgarian children&rsquo;s rights and prosperity and awarded them with the&nbsp;statue of a Golden Apple.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Now he has a new vision: The Children&rsquo;s House in Sofia. This will be something like a child protection &ldquo;mall&rdquo; with conference and meeting rooms for child protection events and workshops; offices for the coalition&rsquo;s NGOs; playgrounds for children and an educational centre for children with special needs; accommodation and a restaurant for international and local guests. Following a social enterprise model, he wants to hire disadvantaged young people to run the place.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Everybody has told him that he was crazy to even think he could raise the huge amount of money necessary to carry out his idea, but Joro went ahead and did it anyway.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He is now building the House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;How am I supposed to feed a teenager with one Euro a day?&rdquo;</div><p>Among the group gathered in Belgrade, Moldovan Mariana Ianachevici&rsquo;s laughter is the loudest. It&rsquo;s contagious, the kind of laughter you want to cling to in the midst of a large and&nbsp;unfamiliar gathering.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">If one can still laugh like that after twenty-five years of helping victims of trafficking and abuse, and if one can still talk about taking home the last ten unwanted teenagers from a&nbsp;closed orphanage in Chisinau, there must be a parallel world better than the statistics suggest.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Mariana Ianachevici is a three-time President - she is President of ChildPact, the President of the Child Protection NGOs Federation in the Republic of Moldova, as well as the President of her own NGO, which has assisted more than 1,200 children over&nbsp;twenty years.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The future President of the country,&rdquo; she laughs, before&nbsp;relating stories about surviving the winter with canned vegetables and frozen fruits harvested from her NGO&nbsp;centre&rsquo;s tiny orchard.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;How am I supposed to feed a teenager with one Euro a day? This is all the state gives me.

At that time, she had no idea she was joining a battle that would change her life.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;After five years, I fell into a depression that would last for six months,&rdquo; Gheorghe recalls. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t distinguish colors anymore, I was seeing only black and white.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">She was representing&nbsp;abused children in lawsuits with the aggressors and, during her last trial, Gheorghe experienced a miscarriage.

Some Avon workers joined them in&nbsp;solidarity.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;This was a matter of honour for me as a woman,&rdquo; Eylem says in a cheerful and steely voice.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">During their mammoth two-month sit-in, the women revealed the miserable working conditions endured by female workers for a global giant that trumpets its brand as &lsquo;the company for women&rsquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the warehouse, women do much of the heavy lifting of boxes of high-turnover products, physical sickness is common - and work-days have lasted over 14 hours, protesting staff claim.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;For me, this is a fight for all women working under heavy conditions,&rdquo; adds Eylem, who supports her mother and sister on her wages.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The six fired workers had joined a union called DGD-Sen - for warehouse, shipbuilding and naval transport workers, and were trying to mobilise their colleagues to challenge bosses about their dire conditions.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The women were also protesting against a dodgy contract drawn up by Avon&rsquo;s subcontractor, a German company named Kl&uuml;h Multiservice.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Germans gave no reason for Eylem&rsquo;s dismissal until weeks later.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Every Friday I went to the door and asked for an official meeting with Avon and Kl&uuml;h,&rdquo; says Eylem, &ldquo;and every Friday for 64 days, I was rejected.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Global brands &ldquo;outsource&rdquo; blue-collar work</div><p>Avon launched in the Turkish market in 1993 and opened its only warehouse in the country in Gebze in 2007. This functions as a hub for Avon&rsquo;s range of cosmetics, jewellery, care products and lingerie, distributed to company representatives in Turkey.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Around 165 out of 223 warehouse workers are technically employed by Kl&uuml;h Multiservice (the companies would not confirm these numbers). Kl&uuml;h is based 2,500 kilometers away&nbsp;in D&uuml;sseldorf. Operational in eight countries, the company also hires cleaners, bodyguards and caterers.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">It is illegal in Turkey to hire workers through subcontractors, unless the purposes of the company and its subcontractors are different.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The DGD-Sen union claims that Kl&uuml;h is breaking Turkish labor law by taking on the majority of Avon&rsquo;s blue-collar workforce.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;These workers are doing work for Avon, but they are not Avon employees - it is unacceptable,&rdquo; says Pelin Das, a DGD-Sen union officer.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Confronted with this allegation Avon and Kl&uuml;h said: &ldquo;we outsource many activities which are out of scope of our core business, including warehouse and shipping activities.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In Turkey, global brands contracting out its&nbsp;working&nbsp;class labor&nbsp;is common, as it can allow big names to use a third party to tacitly permit low wages, job insecurity and union-busting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Job security &ldquo;crushed&rdquo;</div><p>When Kl&uuml;h was hired as Avon subcontractor in December 2015, its officials presented workers with new contracts that allowed the Germans to move the workers where they wanted, give them more work when they wanted, and hire them out to who they wanted.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This&nbsp;stipulated that Kl&uuml;h can change an employee&rsquo;s city of work without the employee&rsquo;s approval. Kl&uuml;h also had the right to &ldquo;lend&rdquo; the employee to any other company.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The contract required employees to work extra shifts or weekend and holiday shifts without&nbsp;negotiation.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;That was the last drop, then we exploded,&rdquo; says Eylem. &ldquo;90 workers refused to sign the contract.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Tensions grew and the workers sought help from the local union.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">On 19 May 2016, Eylem G&ouml;rg&uuml; received a call from Kl&uuml;h&rsquo;s HR.

After a decade at the warehouse, she knew every part of the operations, and was now working as the &lsquo;joker card&rsquo; - taking up any job that was available to make the&nbsp;operations ran smoothly.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Eylem would start&nbsp;at 7:30 am in the morning and sometimes work until 10:00 at night.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;We complained to the Ministry of Labor - so Avon had to let us finish at 8:00 pm,&rdquo; she claims. &ldquo;We are on our feet all day and had to lift heavy packages. Many girls suffer from back, neck and wrist problems.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Workers claim that Avon usually cares little about these health problems. &ldquo;If you say you&rsquo;re ill or suffering, you really must be dying for them to let you go home or to the hospital,&rdquo; Eylem says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Confronted with these allegations, Avon and Kl&uuml;h said that Avon &ldquo;rigorously meets and where possible exceeds global health and safety rules and protection.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;After ten years of dedicated work for Avon I was still making the minimum wage of 390 Euro a month,&rdquo; Eylem says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Meanwhile those workers with Avon contracts were earning double this figure, say staff.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Eylem also received no severance pay - which a Turkish employer must honour. When we confronted Avon and Kl&uuml;h with this apparent breach of their legal responsibility, the companies did not answer.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">After several weeks of protest, the global giant and their German subcontractor told her she was fired due to &ldquo;disturbing peace at work and unethical behaviour&rdquo;. This was a convenient clause for her employers to invoke, as they do not need to provide&nbsp;extra income after the dismissal.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When confronted with workers seeking to form unions, many Turkish-based employers use this excuse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Over 130 years of &ldquo;standing&rdquo; for women</div><p>The Avon brand prides itself on a company that &ldquo;for 130 years has stood for beauty, innovation, optimism and, above all, for women&rdquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This tagline causes Eylem to laugh.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;You know that empowerment motto is a lie, right?&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Only men become supervisors in our workplace. Women do the heavy work - such as carrying boxes and lifting packages. Men just shout orders and insults.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The union was aiming to push Avon to dump its subcontracting contract with Kl&uuml;h and pay proper wages to female workers by making them official Avon employees.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It is impossible to climb the career ladder in Avon,&rdquo; alleges Pelin Das. &ldquo;The women work for ten years and are still stuck with the minimum wage. But men get Avon employee contracts.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Avon says that three quarters of its subcontracted staff are male, and that it regularly asks &ldquo;for feedback from our Associates and outsourced employees regarding their working environment, communication and overall atmosphere&rdquo; and that it has a &rdquo;people-focused approach&rdquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Avon markets itself as the company of women, but a woman is worth nothing inside Avon,&rdquo; says Eylem. &ldquo;For example Avon has this breast cancer campaign. [Many of] its warehouse workers are women and the company could have said &lsquo;let&rsquo;s take you for a breast cancer screening&rsquo;. But they never did.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Empowerment should start from within. If Avon really empowered us, we would be unstoppable. Imagine the things we would have achieved if that was the case. Instead, they kicked us out.&rdquo;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Crunch meeting: in a shopping mall</div><p>Eventually, Kl&uuml;h agreed to meet the fired workers on 17 August.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;They wanted the meeting to take place in a coffee shop at a shopping mall, not in their offices,&rdquo; says Eylem.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Three Kl&uuml;h employees were present in the meeting, alongside Eylem&rsquo;s union representative and lawyer. Eylem asked why they refused her requests for a talk for so long.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The operations director Zafer Koptagel told her that he wished she hadn&rsquo;t brought her lawyer. Eylem kept on pushing: &ldquo;Is this how much you value your employees?&rdquo; She remembers how none of them made an eye-contact with her throughout the meeting. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t even answer me,&rdquo; she says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The union presented the company with their demands - to reinstate the fired workers, pay severance pay and compensation. They also demanded the union be recognised. At first, the company representatives said they would think about it.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A second meeting on 25 August was &ldquo;much shorter and much colder,&rdquo; says Eylem.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Kl&uuml;h presented a counter-proposal of some severance pay. The sacked employees refused.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It was full severance pay and compensation for being fired, or nothing,&rdquo; Eylem says. The company representatives cut the meeting short.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Meanwhile Avon did not participate in any of these meetings and still refuses to recognise or negotiate with the elected union.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Eylem and another female worker decided to pursue this in court. They lodged a complaint against both Avon and Kl&uuml;h in June.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The trial is likely to be a long process, but Eylem is hopeful. Even her name is representative of movement. In Turkish, the meaning of &lsquo;Eylem&rsquo; is &lsquo;action&rsquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;There is a struggle for women everywhere; at work, at home, on the streets,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But women who resist&nbsp;power and demand their rights are beautiful. They should know not to underestimate us anymore.

You stay completely paralyzed by fear, because it's a way to suffer less. Because if you resist, you don&rsquo;t have many options against five men.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Now living in Spain, Amelia Tiganus grew up in Galati in east Romania in the early 00s. When she was 13 years old, five local boys gang-raped her. The men were known as hooligans in the neighbourhood, but they never faced arrest. And they came back to her. To rape her several times. Amelia says that at that time in Galati, it was common to be raped.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;They threatened me by saying that my parents would know I was a<em> whore</em>,&rdquo; she says now. &ldquo;So it got easier for them to access my body. I was trapped by those threats and I could not do anything to get rid of the rapists.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The boys were known to everyone in town.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;I did not turn them in. Few girls turn in their attackers. Their friends would be out there making the victim&rsquo;s life hell. Plus society is always casting doubt on the woman&rsquo;s words, and saying &lsquo;She must have done something&rsquo;, or &lsquo;She deserved it&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">When she was not with the men, locals in town would&nbsp;kick her and spit on her. &ldquo;All my society put a stigma on me. I had the label of 'whore' because I was raped at 13. Being a good girl was out of reach.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Her parents did not know.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;My biggest worry was not to disappoint them and - like every child - I wanted to be loved and my parents to be proud of me, so I felt I had done something wrong. I was afraid of telling my parents, in case they rejected me.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Suicide was in her thoughts.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;[I could not do it] because of the love I had for my sister and I did not want to leave her alone, because I would kill anyone who did to her what they did to me.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Her friends abandoned her.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;The parents of other girls forbid their daughters to be with me, fearing they could be raped as I was. So I was isolated. And I think the same happens to other girls [in the same situation]. There were a lot of us, but we were scattered, not having a relationship between one another. Because it was shameful.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Despite a desire to study, Amelia left school, and, at 14, started working in a car-wash, then in a shop sewing clothes.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;I started to say to myself: &lsquo;Ok, I am a whore. I want to have sex with a lot of men&rsquo;. It was easier to cope with. Because having someone lying over your body while you think &lsquo;I do want&rsquo; is easier than thinking &lsquo;I do not want&rsquo;. At the bottom of your heart you do not want it, but it is a way to protect yourself.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">\\\"I was &lsquo;empowered&rsquo; in sex. But it was not a real empowerment. I did not live my sexuality, but the sexuality of others. We are not open to listen to someone who says: &lsquo;You are a victim&rsquo;. Because it is so painful to realise that we are victims. So we become arrogant - just to have the illusion that we have the control.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/spain2.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 1800px; height: 1126px;\\\"></p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: rgb(116, 192, 226); font-weight: bold;\\\">&ldquo;Most exploited girls don&rsquo;t see themselves as victims&rdquo;</span></div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">When she was 18 in 2002, a friend from Galati contacted her, asking if she wanted to move to Spain. The country was fast becoming a major destination for hundreds of thousands of Romanians looking for jobs, which included sex work.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;Other girls, like me - labelled as <em>whores</em> - &nbsp;knew that in Spain and Italy we could make a lot of money because there was a demand for prostitution.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">But her friend sold&nbsp;her to a&nbsp;trafficking gang for 3,000 Euro. Amelia was under their control&nbsp;for three weeks. She escaped, but was alone in Spain with no work permit or money, so started working as a prostitute. For five years she was circulating around brothels in Spain, changing her location more or less every two weeks. 90 per cent of the girls that worked there were Romanians - many from Galati and its sister town Braila.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">In that period, a prostitute earned 4,000 Euro per month. She split her earnings 50-50 with her pimps, sent money home, and was semi-free.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">\\\"Those pimps playing the role of businessmen are taking advantage of our situation to make&nbsp;us&nbsp;work very long shifts. Although I was presumably free to do it and that I was able to leave, I could not take a day off. I had to stay&nbsp;in the room for which I was paying 70 Euro&nbsp;per day. From 5 PM to 5 AM, I was not allowed to enter my room alone, I could only enter with a man and if the room was already paid&nbsp;for.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The vast majority of pimps were Romanians. They come in two types, argues Amelia - those who use psychological violence and those who use physical<em> and </em>psychological violence. Many girls could not escape because the pimps threatened to harm their families in Romania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">But in the majority of cases the pimps are smarter. To ensure the loyalty of women, they use the strategy of love. Many are the 'boyfriend' or 'husband' of the girl.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;The girls do not even think about escaping because&nbsp;what they have is a relationship with a man and a life together. They believe in that story. Most girls who are being trafficked or exploited don&rsquo;t identify themselves as victims.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Nine years ago she left prostitution to live with her Romanian boyfriend.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;I wanted to work in a normal job,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But one month after we started a new life, he asked me to go back to the club because he could not find a job. Although he did not look for one! But I was fed up with prostitution. After five years, I said &lsquo;Enough&rsquo;. I sat in a chair and I said no to clients and ran up debt with the brothel.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;My boyfriend&rsquo;s answer was to put all my clothes in two garbage bags and leave to Romania with his BMW and all the money I earned, while our house in Spain was in his name. I put everything under his name because I understood it was all for us, for our love. So I lost everything.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">When she left the brothel, she became depressed. But she found solace in study.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;I read books of psychology and discovered feminism and the existence of patriarchy, and I arrived at that point of being aware of what happened to me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I could put a name to what happened. Everything crystallised. So I decided to take the stigma out of me and tell everybody, because I thought it was unfair to shut up.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">\\\"A lot of us say nothing after leaving prostitution. We do not want anyone to know. A lot of women&nbsp;say they have rebuilt their lives, but to live in silence is not to rebuild your life. The world has to know there is something wrong and is letting this injustice happen.&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"Woman for sale on Calle de le Montera\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Girls-Trafficked%20(1).jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9; height: 466px; width: 700px;\\\"></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Tourism hub: Romanians and Nigerians split market</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Calle de la Montera is the bustling pedestrian spine of Madrid&rsquo;s tourism centre. McDonald&rsquo;s and open cafes are packed with European pensioners and American inter-railers munching on <em>churros con chocolate</em>, with a view onto&nbsp;sex shops and beggars.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Here girls between 18 and 25 stand under trees, against shop facades, walk up and down a narrow strip of pavement, in tight clothes, platform heels and&nbsp;ripped short jeans.&nbsp;They are hard-faced, quick-talking,&nbsp;stubborn in negotiation and pop bubble-gum.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">We are trying to talk to Romanian girls. We suspect they are all Romanians. We start asking them where they are from. All the girls who we think are Romanian, are Romanian. Some have been here for years. Decades even. Others are new on the scene.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The upper part of the street close to the McDonald&rsquo;s on Gran Via is dominated by Romanians, the lower half towards Puerta del Sol by Nigerians.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">We talk to a girl, black-haired, early twenties, just over five feet tall, she has been there for six months, in the same location, a prime spot.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">She looks at us - we are two men - and says she will talk for 15 minutes for 50 Euro. It seems 25 Euro is the going rate for 15 minutes of full sex. We are being charged double - because there are two of us.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Later we mention to a former client of prostitutes that 25 Euro seems a low price.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;But what happens if you don&rsquo;t finish during that time?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;Ah - the girl gets bored, she taps you on the back and says - 'Come on, guy, get on with it, I don&rsquo;t have all day'.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Spain: \\\"The Pimp State\\\"</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Spain is seen as the capital of sex work&nbsp;in Europe - with between 40,000 and 100,000&nbsp;prostitutes, according to the interim findings of a report by the Universidad de Comillas. The report estimates that &lsquo;at least&rsquo; 30 per cent of these women are from Romania, but the figure could be higher. Meanwhile around one in five Spanish men admit to paying for sex.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">But the prostitution law is &ldquo;in a kind of limbo&rdquo;, says Magdalena Queipo de Llano, international chief in ACCEM, a humanitarian NGO that assist victims of trafficking.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The controversial new&nbsp;Law of Citizen's Security,&nbsp;passed in 2015, does not criminalise prostitution, but gives fines to anyone engaging in acts of &lsquo;obscene exhibition&rsquo; or those against &lsquo;sexual freedom,&rsquo; for which the fine&nbsp;<span style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">is between 100 and 600 Euro</span>.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Also subject to fines are clients who ask for sex and prostitutes who accept money near a school, park or where there could be a risk for traffic safety. The fine for that is between 601 and 30,000 Euro.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">The idea is to shift the problem off the street. The new law means the police sweep up prostitutes in areas where the neighbours complain - but do not provide a safe area for sex workers.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;Instead of going to public places, clients go to brothels - which are not recognised as brothels under Spanish rules,&rdquo; says Silvia Garc&iacute;a of civil rights NGO Hetaira. &ldquo;There is no labour relationship recognised between employer and employee. They don&rsquo;t have a legal instrument to confront a system of work which can be very abusive.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">There are around 1,600 brothels in Spain, where they are known as &lsquo;clubs&rsquo;. But this is a grey market, where women who engage in sexual services can sign up to the authorities as 'waitresses'&nbsp;in order to pay their taxes. As far as Spain is concerned, a prostitute is employed - but not as a prostitute. This&nbsp;generates an industry for small towns, which cash in on the tax revenues&nbsp;of a euphemistic business. This is&nbsp;one reason why Amelia Tiganus calls Spain &lsquo;The Pimp State&rsquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Now women are in night clubs, in apartments&nbsp;or contactable through small ads and flyers. Some still walk the streets undisturbed. One accosted a writer of this article outside a nursery school - which shows the law isn't really working.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">More are online, advertising themselves as though they were part of an online dating agency.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;This gives the impression girls are freelance, but they are not,&rdquo; says Queipo de Llano. &ldquo;Many young guys between 18 to 25, instead of going to a disco,&nbsp;go in&nbsp;a group to a club and they consume women. We try and make them know the girl might be forced [into her job].&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">ACCEM has made a profile of the typical victim of human trafficking in Spain: this is female, between 23 and 27 years of age - and Romanian. But few women have the confidence and support to challenge their aggressors.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Maria [not her real name] is one who succeeded. In 2003, as a 22 year-old woman, she was persuaded by one of her neighbours in Romania to travel to Spain for a &ldquo;well-paid and good job opportunity&rdquo;. She took a two-day journey via bus across Europe to reach Spain, travelling as a tourist. When she arrived, her neighbour sold her to a pimp for 3,000 Euro.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Out on the street and monitored by the other women, a pimp forced her to have sex with men and stole her earnings. For nine months, the gang beat her up to keep her silent. An NGO, Proyecto Esperanza (meaning &lsquo;Project Hope&rsquo; in Spanish), which operates outreach work across Spain, contacted her. At first&nbsp;she told them that she had no problems, that she was not being forced to do anything, and that she had no pimp. Slowly she and an outreach worker built up a relationship. One day she was experiencing&nbsp;a personal crisis, opened up and said &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this anymore. I never chose to be here. I want help&rdquo;. The charity organised her escape.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;I found a place to stay,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;&ldquo;The NGO helped me with all the different documents, and with medicine, and I recuperated with the help of a psychologist.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Maria reported her case to the authorities, and the judge declared her a protected witness. Her trafficker was arrested and imprisoned and other women were released. In less than two years, the men were set free&nbsp;and were looking for Maria. She had to change her address, but remained in Spain.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Today she recounts her experience nervously, still fearful of the threats from the gang on her family in Romania. She does not give away too many details - such as where she comes from - and where she lives now.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;In time, I learned the language - it&rsquo;s tough,&rdquo; she says. For 11 years she has worked, she says proudly, &lsquo;legally&rsquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;I had to make my life from the beginning,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;I go out to dinner, play sport, have friends from Romania and Spain. Now I want to make a family.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">She visits her relatives in Romania, but only for two or three days. &ldquo;Everything I built up would no longer exist if I returned to Romania.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Marta Gonz&aacute;lez, general coordinator at Proyecto Esperanza, says that Maria was brave, because she was ready to risk all to free herself.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">But some women cannot spend time out of work to recover in a shelter.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;In a few cases, some victims&nbsp;have said: 'I understand, I have this opportunity, but I need to work, I need to have money to send to my family,'&rdquo; says Gonz&aacute;lez. &ldquo;They are in an irregular situation, especially if they don&rsquo;t know the language, and they tend to go back to prostitution.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Proyecto Esperanza has not seen only uneducated women from Romania - one victim was a translator, who needed more cash, so&nbsp;came to Spain for work.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;There was a woman who came to Spain with her husband, had a child here, had different jobs, and when the crisis happened, she lost her job, they split, and the kid went back to Romania. She could not find a job anymore, so was in a vulnerable situation,&rdquo; says Gonz&aacute;lez.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Two Romanian men befriended her, and asked her all about her life, before exploiting her. This was a form of social engineering. She was forced to have sex with men in a private flat. If she refused, the men would threaten her family.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;They told her: &lsquo;We know now where your child lives in Romania. <em>We are here and we are also there</em>. If you don&rsquo;t do what we tell you, you won&rsquo;t see child anymore.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">This means a major part of the recovery process is that victims need to regain trust in people, after those close to the women have used violence and forced slavery upon them.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&ldquo;It affects you, friendship, relationships. One of the most difficult things to overcome is &lsquo;how can I trust someone, when I did trust someone and they did this to me?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Gonz&aacute;lez has also seen &ldquo;quite a few cases&rdquo; of girls from Romanian orphanages. Romania continues to have a major problem with abandoned children who are kept in state institutions. &ldquo;There are these very young girls, who turn 18, and have to abandon an institution, where they have been all their life,&rdquo; says Gonz&aacute;lez. &ldquo;They do not have structured family or support, so they are very vulnerable to a boyfriend or someone offering opportunities in Spain.&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\"><img alt=\\\"Foreigners talking to Romanian prostitutes on Calle de la Montera, Madrid\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/IMG_2522.jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9; height: 466px; width: 700px;\\\"></div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Made in Romania: Europe&rsquo;s largest prostitute network</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Trafficking in Romanian women hit a high point between 2002 and 2010. It started in the early 2000s when work migration boomed between Romania and Spain.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">In the first six to seven years, most of those coming to Madrid were from &#538;&#259;nd&#259;rei, a town of 12,000 in the South-East of Romania, says Marinela Ifrim, a Romanian working with ACCEM in Madrid.&nbsp;At that time, a Romanian had to spend up to 10,000 dollars to pay someone for a visa and travel to Spain. \\\"They came with huge debts and, in the first years, they would work only to repay the debts,\\\" says Ifrim.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Criminal groups were operating scams to bring over Romanians. Many of these were run by Romanian gangster Ioan Clamparu, known as &lsquo;Cap de Porc&rsquo; [Pig Head], who became Romania&rsquo;s most wanted man during that decade.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Born in Botosani, his other nicknames include Omo, Ion de Madrid and &lsquo;the Ghost&rsquo; - because he had poor social skills.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">Clamparu cooperated with a Romanian travel agency in the early 2000s which acted as a front to traffic women. Noticing that the Spanish market of prostitutes did not include young girls, his gang trafficked over 600&nbsp;from Romania - some in their 20s or younger, promising many jobs in domestic service or hospitality. The members forced girls into debt, took away their ID, and then asked them to pay back the debt through sex. The women came to dominate the Madrid zones of Casa de Campo and Marconi, generating between 300 and 600 Euro per day. Allegedly, he offered one &lsquo;unique selling point&rsquo; to the clients of his enslaved women - the girls would not just offer sex, they would also kiss.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">By 2004 he had set up a network of family clans in different Romanian regions, modelled in part on the Italian mafia, helping him gain the nickname of &lsquo;the Godfather&rsquo; [Nasuc].</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">In Spain, the gang would control their movements using men or &lsquo;trusted&rsquo; women. If the victims complained, they were subject to beatings or rape. If they got pregnant, they were forced to have an abortion. It&rsquo;s alleged that girls who&nbsp;defied the gang risked being tied up, their teeth pulled out, or being <a href=\\\"http://www.farodevigo.es/galicia/2015/02/27/horror-victimas-ioan-clamparu/1192390.html\\\">attacked by dogs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">By the mid-decade he was operating&nbsp;the largest network of pimps in Europe, alongside&nbsp;350 women, while&nbsp;his accomplices were transferring 200,000 Euro bundles in cash from Spain to Romania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">After seven years on the run, he and 190 of members of an international gang across 13 countries were arrested. Clamparu was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2012, for&nbsp;forcing a 17 year-old to abort and incitement to prostitution.

From Lithuania. Now he is living in Germany. He has been committing crimes since he was six. Theft and assault. When he was young, the life of crime was romantic. Once he was inside the milieu, he says it was easier &ldquo;to live outside the law&rdquo;.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Algirdas has spent half his life in prison. In Russia, Latvia, and Lithuania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But in 2008, he left the post-Soviet space. He came to England. At first, he kept himself clean. No stealing. He was looking for work. He slept on the streets.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Then he landed a job at a hotel. His first ever legal job. But he became sick, and the hotel stopped paying him.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">So he lost the job, and was living on benefits from the British state. And he kept getting picked up by the cops for assault and battery. On four occasions.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I can't remember the last time,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I was drunk and I turned up at the police station with knives in my hands.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When he commits a crime in the UK, his past record flashes up from his home country, detailing his previous convictions for theft.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;But there were many years,&rdquo; says Algirdas, &ldquo;when I didn&rsquo;t steal.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He says he has no regrets. He claims he only ever got caught because he was drunk. No one ever arrested him for thieving when he was sober.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Since he left jail in the UK, a&nbsp;Lithuanian police officer helped Algirdas find a job and and a home, but not everyone is so lucky.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Sometimes life itself makes people steal,&rdquo; he says.</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Lithuania: top EU country for expat crime</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the EU, Lithuanians have the highest percentage of their expat population in jail.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">From around 330,000 Lithuanian expats in the EU, around 2,000 are in prison, according to Eurocrimes estimates.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This percentage is at 0.59 - almost double the next highest countries, Latvia and Romania, on 0.39 per cent. This is not a massive number. This is not a crime wave. There is a margin or error here. But it does show a trend. And it doesn't look good for the Baltic state.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Lithuanians are highly involved in thieving gangs. Most of the goods&nbsp;are stolen in the other EU countries and brought back to Lithuania. The gangs target northern Europe - especially the UK, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and Ireland, but they have spread out across the continent.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We quizzed Lithuanian criminals with experience in Italy, Germany, France and the UK to give a snapshot on the lifestyle that has led to this top crime rate.</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Lithuania:&nbsp;gangs 'traffic'&nbsp;thieves to the west</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Algirdas has met about 100 Lithuanians behind bars abroad - a big number, he says. The only motivation for Lithuanians committing crimes is money, says Algirdas. In the UK, almost all of Algirdas&rsquo;s friends were criminals. They were shoplifting and stealing cars.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;At first they'd steal expensive cars and drive them back to Lithuania, but once that alley was blocked [by the EU and state authorities], Lithuanians started disassembling cars and selling them in parts,&rdquo; says Algirdas. &ldquo;Lithuanians are very creative, they'll come up with a way.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In one day, a thief can steal goods from a store worth about &pound;1,500. The prime goods are: phones, computers, gadgets or building tools, says the ex-con.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;There are lots of Lithuanians here, but Lithuanians know how to wriggle out of sticky situations and&nbsp;they get caught very rarely,&rdquo; says Algirdas.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the UK, Lithuanians either sell the hot goods to local dealers or send them back home. &ldquo;Buyers always know they are buying stolen goods, they just aren't worried about it,&rdquo; he adds.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For many years, mini-buses packed with stolen goods were travelling to Lithuania, to be sold in local markets.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Since he was 16, Egidijus Ma&#269;iulis has been a thief. He has been in prison in Germany, the UK and is now locked up in Lithuania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It was always small thefts &nbsp;&ndash; from shops and&nbsp;houses,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I was too lazy to work, even though I had opportunities.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Egidijus came to the UK when he was 28 in 2006. &ldquo;There were some friends. Similar guys, colleagues, we started stealing. You get all the opportunities there.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ma&#269;iulis says Lithuanian criminals are&nbsp;in organised groups. Bosses recruit youngsters directly or through blackmail and extortion.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;In the beginning, they promise money and later the youngsters end up being in debt and have to work for them,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a form of control. Later, they get forced into committing various crimes until they end up in prison.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Lithuanians criminal bosses target vulnerable groups, often from the countryside, to pinpoint&nbsp;accomplices to&nbsp;steal&nbsp;and fence&nbsp;goods in the EU.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">To recruit, the bosses go to rural or small towns in Lithuania, where there is huge social exclusion, structural poverty and a high unemployment rate, says Karolis Zibas, research fellow at Vilnius&rsquo;s Institute of Ethnic Studies. Gangs also target orphanages - a strategy that happens in Romania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They will start with a test. Give the youngster a job to steal from a local village shop. The recruiter will say, 'let&rsquo;s go for a drink, have a smoke of weed', and tell the kid:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&lsquo;You&rsquo;re our guy, now steal a chocolate bar from a local shop,&rsquo; and after that, something more expensive.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;They try to get into a familiar relationship,&rdquo; says Zibas. If they succeed, they send the kids to Norway or the UK.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;In that case - the victim does not think they are a victim anymore,&rdquo; says Zibas. &ldquo;They think they are doing it by their own will.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the region, Lithuania has a larger migrant network than Latvia and Estonia,&nbsp;and a higher level of poverty than its neighbour Poland. Around 22 per cent - 600,000 people in Lithuania - are on the poverty line.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;People are being brought from Lithuania to other EU countries not for forced labour or the&nbsp;modern slavery of sexual exploitation, but for implementing criminal activities,&rdquo; says Zibas. &ldquo;Part of the Lithuanian prisoners are not criminals, but victims of human trafficking.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Algirdas argues there are no such gangs operating from within the UK, but from Lithuania. &ldquo;In a lot of cases their bosses live in Lithuania and just send these people to England to commit crimes,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The 'command centre' sits in Lithuania and sends about 50 people, who don't know one another, to the UK. The boss has enough information about the UK and once he finds a thief, he gives him enough money to start his life abroad and strict instructions about crimes to be committed.&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"&ldquo;In the EU, they pay more attention to the Russians and the Polish.

So he fled abroad and hid out with a friend in Munster, Germany.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Most of the time I lived in Germany,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was good in Germany.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But he adds that he was doing nothing there.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;What else can you do in Munster, if you&lsquo;re in hiding?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">So he decided to travel around Europe looking for new places to commit crimes in the shadows.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I stayed in Italy for a few days and I was put in prison... It&rsquo;s that kind of country... I don&rsquo;t know how to explain,&rdquo; he says, before explaining: &ldquo;I was with a friend. My friend got into an argument with some Moroccans and Tunisians. I didn&rsquo;t speak Italian. My friend did. [The Africans] called the police. The cops came and took us. They told the police that we were threatening them. Bullshit. Totally.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t even a translator in the prison. They brought some kind of an Englishman &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t even speak English, what could I have told him? Nothing. That&rsquo;s how I ended up in an Italian prison, until the extradition request came for us.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Drug dealing is easier in mainland Europe than at home in Lithuania due to the low conviction rates, believes Lukijanko, although in truth this may not be the case for every country.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;In Lithuania you get eight to ten years for drug dealing - it&rsquo;s insane!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;[In Germany] the first time, you&rsquo;re caught drug dealing you&rsquo;ll get a fine, something around 300 Euro, second time you&rsquo;ll be on probation, well, the third time they will give me a few years of jail time to teach you a lesson. Here in Lithuania? They catch you one time and you&rsquo;re done. So there&rsquo;s no surprise that everyone is trying to go [abroad] to earn money.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For Lithuanians abroad, crime is easier than at home.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Here everybody from the police knows you, the detectives might be following you, and listening to your conversations.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There [in the EU] people don&lsquo;t pay attention to you. You can do whatever you want there. That&lsquo;s what people are playing on. They pay more attention to the Russians and the Polish. They don&lsquo;t really know yet what Lithuanians are.&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Paris: a better style&nbsp;of life for&nbsp;addicts</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">47 year-old Igor Inta&nbsp;was sentenced to ten years in France for dealing drugs. He is now serving time in a Vilnius jail until 2020. When he was caught in a drug bust, Inta was working in Saint-Denis, a Paris arondissement known as a hotbed for crime.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Inta gives an insight into how the Lithuanians at the poverty level survive, and how the addicts and alcoholics experience more of<em> la grande vie</em>&nbsp;in the Parisian capital than at home.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It&lsquo;s international there, a lot of people. Arabs, Russians, Georgians and Ukrainians,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&lsquo;s a lot of stuff going on in Paris. There are lots of Lithuanians - but more Polish. They get wasted under the bridges, they don&lsquo;t care about life.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;In the Boulevard Barb&egrave;s, they deal in contraband cigarettes from Russia and Belarus, where the price is 2.5 Euro a pack. Uptown &ndash; Chateau Rouge, there are the hookers. Downtown, next to the La Republique, there are associations that give methadone to drug addicts. At Gare du Nord, there are buses that give away methadone and [heroin substitution drug] subutex.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If you want to work, you&lsquo;ll always get a job. Always. There are some people who simply don&lsquo;t want (to work). Why should they? If you have hepatitis, you get free treatment. There are places in France where you can eat for free. All kinds of organizations come, next to Gare du Nord and La Republique. And they make a living out of that. For them it&lsquo;s enough to have 400 Euro per month, 200 Euro more in food stamps. With them you can buy any kind of food, except cigarettes and alcohol. [The French] give you a place to stay. Even the homeless. Some live on basketball courts. Under the courts are pipes. The ground is warm all year round. They live in tents.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;They drink, they need money, so they steal. If you go from Boulevard Barb&egrave;s to Pigalle, through this park, there are Russians and Lithuanians &ndash; wherever there&rsquo;s is a shop, where they can steal something and drink it on the spot. They get caught, but after 20-30 hearings in court they&rsquo;re free. They took what &ndash; some sausage and a bottle of wine? So what?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Originally, these people were planning to earn money in their new country. &ldquo;But somewhere deep inside they like to drink &ndash; they start and can&rsquo;t stop. Then they find other alcoholics. They say, look, here&rsquo;s a place to sleep, here&rsquo;s a place to wash yourself, you can steal there and you&rsquo;ll never be hungry.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Brexit: an &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; to round up Lithuanians</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Algirdas has a theory that the UK was not paying much attention to Lithuanian crime - until the Brexit vote on 23 June this year, when the UK voted by a narrow margin to leave the European Union.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Once the UK EU Referendum started approaching, they figured they needed to do something about it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Social services, which take care of the homeless and needy people, also got to know about the crimes these people had committed. Scotland Yard had been gathering information about criminals, but didn't touch them, if they hadn't harmed anyone seriously.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Now more Lithuanian criminals are put behind bars in the UK. &ldquo;Recently they've started massively locking up Lithuanians and other immigrants, because they have been sitting on this information for long and they had to act immediately,&rdquo; he argues. &ldquo;Hundreds of Lithuanians are sent to prisons.\\\"</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Prison: in Britain \\\"we had everything\\\"</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For Algirdas, prison is his home. Even if the bars and the cells are&nbsp;in Lithuania, Russia or the United Kingdom. But he says that in the UK, the jail feels more like a guest-house than a deprivation&nbsp;of liberty.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Once I got there, I couldn't figure out where I was - I had everything, just that I was locked up in a cell,&rdquo; says Algirdas. &ldquo;[In Russia] I have spent 90 days in solitary. I had no soap, towels, even sheets, just - pure concrete and food every second day. That's what I call a true prison.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">After a year and a half of stealing, the police caught Egidijus Ma&#269;iulis and he was sentenced to jail in the UK. But he was also surprised about the niceties of the UK system.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;They set me free really fast, because the sentences are really light there,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even feel it and you can start all over again&hellip; In their system, if you&rsquo;re sentenced under six years, you spend half of the sentence and you're free. The youth look at the [length of the] sentences. We go to commit crimes, so, let&lsquo;s look up what&lsquo;s going to happen to us. We know that the first time they let us go, nothing happens. That&lsquo;s how they do it. Last time, I had to stay a bit longer &ndash; I got sentenced for 2.5 years. I have stayed there for one year and four months, half of the sentence.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But this did not work out in the way that Ma&#269;iulis expected.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;After that, I wasn&rsquo;t free, I got deported and went straight to a Lithuanian prison.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">All the convicts believed that time inside an EU prison was more accommodating than at home. Ma&#269;iulis was impressed by the assistance and personal attention he encountered in British jail system, which he has spent three spells exploring.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Every time the prison tried to put me back on track.\\\" he says. \\\"They asked, what do you need? Do you need rehabilitation? Do you need accommodation? Do you need work? Do you need education? They provided me with everything. They gave me the foundation.

Romanians also monopolized&nbsp;the&nbsp;line in stealing copper cables from transport connections and hospitals, melting it down and selling it for scrap.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;In the beginning of the 2000s, there was a wave of Romanian crime,&rdquo; says Vincenzo Nicoli, Second Department of the Central Operative Service in the Italian Police.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But now, in 2016, the official states that because there are a large number of Romanians in Italy, there is a level of crime reflective of this population surge.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Romanian crime mainly strikes&nbsp;large cities in Italy - Turin, Bologna, Milan and Rome, where the expats have settled.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But there is no specific crime related to all Romanians.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;There is no Romanian problem,&rdquo; says a lawyer who&nbsp;represents&nbsp;Romanian suspects in Italy, Piero Piccinini. &ldquo;It is impossible to speak of a specific Romanian criminal trend. It would be like trying to&nbsp;specify a type of crime from Tuscany or Lazio.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But Romanians are becoming more organized. As the citizens of their country are escalating through the ranks of Italian civic life to achieve better qualifications and gain higher paid jobs, start their own businesses and develop the Italian economy, their criminals are also&nbsp;more professional.</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Romanians: seizing&nbsp;the jobs the mafia don&rsquo;t want to do</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Romanian criminals in Italy have followed a similar path to those from Albania. They arrived in massive numbers in the late 1990s and started committing&nbsp;the high-risk and visible&nbsp;crimes that Italians no longer wanted to do.</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">While the Albanians gravitated more to drug trafficking, the Romanians took up theft and pimping. &ldquo;The Italian criminal organizations allowed those foreigners to do certain activities in which they had no further interest,&rdquo; says Nicoli.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The police official adds that many criminal organizations from the Balkans have a background that can include military training, and a readiness to use violence. They are tougher. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;All the people who come from strong military training know how to use weapons and they have self defense techniques,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They are physically prepared for any kind of aggression - which makes the difference between them and an Italian, who eats pizza all the time.&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Ro-on-Ro crime: the major trend</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A large number of Romanian crimes take place within their own communities. Since the mid-90s, Romanian gangs have been trafficking their own citizens for sex work, forcing their own people to beg, and preying on their own people&nbsp;with loan scams. These can be easier to undertake abroad than at home because the victims are in a more vulnerable position. Due to the language and cultural barriers, the local authorities are, at first, baffled&nbsp;by what is going on.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If I had to say something about the Romanian&nbsp;organized groups, I'd say they are particularly specialized in committing crimes against their own nationals in big communities in large cities,&rdquo; says Nicoli.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In Turin, Romanians created an Italian-style mafia within their local community. Using techniques similar to the southern Italian mafia - Cosa Nostra, Camorra and the 'Ndrangheta - they would extort money from Romanian night-clubs that ran prostitutes, and impose their own businesses and singers on weddings by force.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This was not a Romanian Roma group. Nicoli has never seen Roma groups involved in&nbsp;organized crime in Italy.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the Turin example, he says there is a full tree of a military organization with a figurehead and a second line of command. The case file includes wired conversations where the members of the gang discuss that if one from their clan&nbsp;goes to prison, the group will pay expenses for his family. This is a &ldquo;quantum leap&rdquo; in the development of such a&nbsp;group, says Nicoli.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If I belong to a criminal group, and I do not have to worry about being arrested because my family will have a livelihood, I clearly offer a higher level of loyalty to the organization,&rdquo; he adds.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">However Romanian mafia gangs have no chance to compete with their Italian neighbours. Take Naples, for example, where crime is run by the Camorra.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If there are foreign communities who commit crimes in Naples, they do so solely because they are allowed,&rdquo; says Fausto Lamparelli, head of Squadra Mobile, Naples Police.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Organized Romanian crime &ldquo;would not be possible in Naples&rdquo; because of the Camorra, which has a monopoly on drug-dealing and extortion.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Gangs of thieves&nbsp;in Naples from Romania have stolen wallets and phones from people&rsquo;s bags. &ldquo;But pickpockets have to be careful from whom they choose to rob - not from the Camorra,&rdquo; says Lamparelli. &ldquo;It may happen that if they commit the crime against the wrong person, they can die.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Romanians&rsquo; prime target: the ATM machine</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Romanians have recently gravitated from plain theft to attacking jewellery stores and blowing up ATM machines.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">At night, they ram-raid a bank with a vehicle. Smash to pieces the front wall. Steal the ATM machine. Chuck it in a truck. Take it to a remote place. Blow it up with an injection of acetylene gas, and steal the money. Because this does not involve weapons, the guilty party is subject to less severe sentences - as it is seen as theft, not armed robbery.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The video below, provided by the Carabinieri, is from what the cops&nbsp;have called a mixed Romanian-Bosnian 'Roma' gang of second generation immigrants:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\\\"\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"480\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dt7JQiExlpo\\\" width=\\\"853\\\"></iframe></div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no more the case of the Romanian who enters the house taking advantage of the open window, there is now a group of Romanians who are better organized,&rdquo; says Nicoli.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Further evidence of this growing sophistication emerged last September, when Italy was&nbsp;rocked by the revelation of a Romanian criminal &ldquo;school&rdquo;. In December 2013, a gang of five armed men in ski masks broke into a Rolex dealer in Florence. They had also hit a store in Paris. After three years of investigation, the police arrested eight of them.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The crime bosses&nbsp;recruited their members from Romanian orphanages. According to the prosecutor Giuseppe Creazzo, the 'orphans' were&nbsp;trained in robbery at&nbsp;an &ldquo;academy of crime&rdquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The press has stated these men belong to &ldquo;a paramilitary group of over 300 men trained to pull off robberies across Europe&rdquo;. They were subject to military training for four months in the forests of Romania, learned how to use&nbsp;axes, how to change clothes in a hurry, escape without a trace, sleep outdoors and<a href=\\\"http://www.controradio.it/rapina-gioielleria-firenze-arrestati-appartenenti-a-gruppo-paramilitare/\\\"> withstand harsh climates</a>.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Meanwhile the cloning of credit cards at ATM machines is &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; the preserve of Romanians and Bulgarians, according to&nbsp;Naples police chief Fausto Lamparelli.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The thieves install a device called a &lsquo;skimmer&rsquo; on ATM card slots that records all the data from a credit or debit card. They can also attach the skimmer to ticket machines at a train station or any automatic device that accepts cards.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;This copies the data from the magnetic strip. [The gang]&nbsp;films the card-holder&nbsp;typing his&nbsp;PIN code - and then he's screwed,&rdquo; says Lamparelli.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The gang members position the video-and-skimmer kits&nbsp;in petrol stations or corner stores. Small shops also&nbsp;accept to be part of the game for a short time.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">With the data, groups can create&nbsp;a white credit card with the same magnetic strip. Over a short time, they either make a series of small purchases, or one&nbsp;big expensive payment. The client sees his money vanishing. He panics. The insurance company foots the bill.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I had my personal credit card cloned,&rdquo; says the Naples police chief.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When looking at his bank statement, Lamparelli was shocked to find he had bought plane tickets from Spain to Romania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Investigations are difficult because they are transnational,\\\" he says. \\\"My card was definitely cloned on the Internet. We never found the person responsible.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This credit card fraud has a high incidence rate, but peaked a few years ago. These are criminals who move around different countries, because they do not want to draw attention. But they are not Roma.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Romanians have also been involved in&nbsp;scams involving&nbsp;cars. Here an Italian has a problem with his old, beaten-up Fiat&nbsp;that doesn't work properly any more. It's a rust-bucket.&nbsp;He cannot sell it. He cannot repair it. He cannot dump it. He wants to make some money out of it. So he looks for men who advertise with flyers outside train stations offering &ldquo;cash for cars&rdquo;. These are from Romania, Albania or Bulgaria. The Italian hires them to steal his car.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Romanian, for example, knows the license number. It is easy to break inside. He takes it and drives it to Austria, Hungary and then back to Romania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Two days later the owner calls the police to say the car is stolen,&rdquo; says Mario Pontillo, director of prisoners association Associazione Il Viandante. &ldquo;By that time the car is out of the country. The owner then collects the insurance. If it&rsquo;s a good car, maybe the Romanian can sell it on.&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><span style=\\\"color: rgb(116, 192, 226); font-weight: bold;\\\">Romania: a country or a crime?</span></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Every killing involving a Romanian suspect in Italy becomes a headline event. In 2007, the 47 year-old wife of an Italian marine officer Giovanna Reggiani was walking back home in a suburb of Rome, when she was attacked&nbsp;and beaten to death by a worker from a nearby slum, Romulus Mailat.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This kicked off an Italian media campaign against Romanians. The press demanded action.&nbsp;On the day of Reggiani&rsquo;s death, the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, issued an urgent decree to kick people out of the country for reasons of public security.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This gave the power to local prefects to expel European citizens from Italy for a serious threat against public order. This was not explicitly targeting Romanians - but it was clearly implied. In the weeks following the law, thousands of Romanians were &lsquo;sent back&rsquo; to their home country.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In response to this, civil rights association Antigone lobbied against the proposal and demonstrated wearing T-shirts - which read: &lsquo;Romania: is it a country, or is it a crime?&rsquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The decree wasn&rsquo;t transformed in a regular law, so it was dismissed <a href=\\\"http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/serie_generale/caricaDettaglioAtto/originario?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2007-11-02&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=007G0200&amp;elenco30giorni=false\\\">two&nbsp;months later</a>.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Mailat was jailed for murder and, in 2015, Italy&nbsp;transferred him&nbsp;to a Romanian jail, where he is now serving a life sentence.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">During the investigation and trial, Mailat&rsquo;s lawyer Piero Piccinini says the defendant had no support from the Romanian Government. The Romanians sent a police team to investigate, and Piccinini was invited once to the Consulate to answer a few questions - but nothing else.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I was surprised by the absolute indifference,&rdquo; he says now.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He suspects that this may be&nbsp;because&nbsp;Mailat was Roma.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I was starting from the point of view that Mailat was entitled to have the best possible defense and the Romanian government should have come to the same conclusion,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I did not understand the Romanian government's position - it's like the Romanian Roma were the children of a lesser god.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The integration of Roma in Italian society has not been smooth. Around 8,000 still live in home-made favelas at the edges of large cities such as Naples and Rome. Their legal status is sketchy and many&nbsp;occupants suffer prejudice, arson attacks and aggression from inside and outside&nbsp;their own communities.&nbsp;Neither the Romanians nor the Italians seem interested in finding a comprehensive solution.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The case of Mailat gave some terrifying insight [into this world],}&rdquo; says Piccinini, &ldquo;one of Mailat's friends had gone stealing copper wires, the other stole scooters, another collected their remaining supplies in supermarkets. It came out of a terrible world and we could have done something. What was done? Nothing.&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Romanians: judged by media</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Prejudice against Romanians also has an effect on the prison numbers in Italy.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;There is a strong influence of public opinion and mass media&rdquo; on convictions in the justice system, says Patrizio Gonnella, president of human rights group Antigone, which has analyzed Italian prison data for 20 years.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">On 26 April 2007, a 21 year-old Romanian - Doina Matei - was riding the Rome underground to the central Termini station with a friend. As the&nbsp;crowds exited the train, she was jostling with a 23 year-old Italian woman, Vanessa Russo.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The two argued on the platform.&nbsp;Matei was carrying an umbrella, which she wielded&nbsp;towards Russo. The sharp end&nbsp;hit the Italian in the eye. The victim spent two days in a coma, before dying. Matei fled the scene.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Rome court called the attack&nbsp;a &ldquo;mortal blow&rdquo; and condemned Matei to prison for 16 years. She is <a href=\\\"http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/04/13/doina-matei-sospesa-la-semiliberta-alla-killer-dellombrello-dopo-le-foto-in-bikini-postate-su-facebook/2631988/\\\">now in a semi-open prison</a>.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This April, after nine years inside, Matei was granted eight hours of freedom.

Because she smiled?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Antigone ran&nbsp;a campaign against the judge&rsquo;s ruling. After a few months, the tribunal changed the decision, and reinstated her right to semi-liberty.</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A drinking problem: \\\"solve this, and solve most crimes\\\"</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">On whether there is prejudice against Romanians - and particularly the Romanian Roma - from the legal system, this becomes more complex.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">There are high rates of recidivism among Romanians. This is because many Romanians commit a crime, get released and commit the same crime again inside of five years - which is usually pickpocketing. This increases their sentences.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The law is tougher on recidivists, and this is tougher on Romanians,&rdquo; says Mario Pontillo.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But Piero Piccinini believes there is no bias by judges against Romanians. Instead he argues that there is &ldquo;no attention&rdquo; given &ldquo;or tolerance&rdquo; to the problems that affect immigrant communities. This means that Romanians may get banged up on minor issues, such as falsifying a residence in order to help out a friend.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For Piccinini, the major problem among Romanians is booze. And this is linked to drink-driving accidents.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If we managed to break the habit of alcohol abuse, we would knock down 80 per cent of the crimes,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But alcohol is linked to the lack of family, decent housing, and solitude. Alcohol is an escape.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Most of Piccinini's cases are related to drunkenness or domestic violence.&nbsp;Romanians have little support&nbsp;in Italy to deal with these problems.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If there are one million Romanians in Italy, this is a reality of which we should take note,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Not only the Italian, but also the Romanian Government should put in place a form of administrative, legal and cultural assistance for the millions of Romanians. But this&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Romanians: not ISIS terrorists</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In 2016 the numbers of Romanians in prison in Italy fell from 2,893 to 2,825. This drop was slight - but significant.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;This is a very interesting decrease. It is the first time they don&rsquo;t go up,&rdquo; says Patrizio Gonnella from Antigone. &ldquo;Why? Are Romanians more integrated? I don&rsquo;t think so. Do they commit fewer crimes than two years ago? I don&rsquo;t think so. The persecution of the police and judicial system is now [targeted] against another kind of people. Now we have to face terrorism. Now it is the criminalisation of the Maghreb.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">From June 2015 to June 2016 the top foreign prisoner community in Italy - as in the EU - are from&nbsp;Morocco.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The pressure of ISIS terrorism will change the prejudice against Romanians,&rdquo; says Gonnella. &ldquo;Now the media is interested in terrorist attacks.

But the Romanians were not refugees. They were economic migrants.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Finding a job was hard for the residents of a shanty village. They had no permanent address. No legal status. Employers would not take them seriously.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They turned to cash-in-hand jobs, collecting and selling old iron, aluminium or plastic from rubbish tips.

In August, Gianturco and another, Ponticelli, were threatened with destruction.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Another camp, Barra, is &lsquo;semi-recognized&rsquo; by the local authorities. In July the grass is high in the empty lots around the motorway flyovers. We turn off the main street and onto a gravel road.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A woman in her seventies sits on a deckchair decorated with the Italian flag. Fish are hanging from a wire, drying in the summer sun. Naked children are playing in the dust. Cars are rusting with rugs across their roofs.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We talk to Nita. Heavy-built, in his early 40s, he wears a t-shirt of a heart with the Australian flag inside. Above is printed the word &lsquo;Love&rsquo; and below &lsquo;Me + You&rsquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We ask where he&rsquo;s from.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Calarasi,&rdquo; says Nita.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;All of you?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;<em>Toti&nbsp;din Calarasi</em>.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><em>All are from Calarasi.</em></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Around 80 to 90 families live here. Nita arrived here in 2003 from Calarasi. He knew no one in Naples, but took the risk.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Each of us built his own house,&rdquo; he says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">No one in Italy wants to hire him and his family, so they live from collecting and selling old metal. &ldquo;We get five to ten Eurocents per kilo. In a week you can fill a small car. I get 20 Euro for it.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Begging is another source of income, but Nita - who has five children - says this is risky. &ldquo;If you take the kid begging in summer, they [the police] would say it&rsquo;s too hot [to be out with the child],&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If you do the same in winter, they will say that it&rsquo;s too stormy.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">That morning a Bulgarian Roma turned up with a bag of fish for Nita&rsquo;s family. For him, food is the ultimate proof of kindness. &ldquo;Good people will offer you food,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Nita wants the authorities to provide him with two improvements: a decent access road and more help for the children in Barra. At this moment, about 100 camp children go to Italian school.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I hope they will be smarter than us and that they will have jobs and do what we weren&rsquo;t capable of doing,&rdquo; he says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Roma from these shanty-towns are often kept out of medical care. The need for such services is huge. Around 95 per cent&nbsp;don&rsquo;t have the necessary legal documents, so have access to only basic health support.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;They do not have the right to apply for a pediatrician, so there is no support for the children,&rdquo; says Andrea from Emergency.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Although vaccination is free of charge, many Roma families don&rsquo;t have the medical historical documents&nbsp;for the children with them in Italy, so the NGO doesn&rsquo;t know whether they were immunized in Romania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"All ages live in the camp at Barra, Naples\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/3.jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9; width: 700px; height: 466px;\\\"></p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I told you - all is well&rdquo;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We travel with Andrea to Ponticelli. This is a camp near a disused factory. Here Emergency is helping a man who recently suffered a leg amputation. At the entrance are huge piles of trash.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The houses are improvised from broken pieces of furniture and doors. Some of the residents are outside - sunbathing on sofas.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Kids are playing pool on a table under a tree. But the table has no pockets. So when they hit the balls, they fall through the holes and onto the ground. Rather than put the balls back on the table, the kids lay down on the gravel with their cues, and hit the balls across the dirt.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A thin man in an open shirt and shorts walks up to us.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We ask where he is from.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Calarasi,&rdquo; says the man.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;All of you?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;<em>Toti&nbsp;din Calarasi</em>!&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">How do you like it here? Any problems?</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Everything is fine here,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You can leave.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But we want to talk to you about the camp.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to say, everything is fine. You can leave.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We want to know about what life is like here for Romanians in Italy.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I told you - all is well.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">At the side of the camp we notice a wall made of broken doors, table tops and old furniture. It runs for about 100 metres. On the other side is another camp.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Here the buildings raised off the ground by stilts.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A woman in her fifties in a headscarf talks to us. She is concerned about her son. He finds it hard to get a job and to get on with Italians in the city. She is worried that he does not know the language. Andrea tells her again, what he has told her before, that her son needs psychological, not medical care.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">We ask her why there is a wall.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The people here are from [the northern Romanian city] Cluj,&rdquo; she says, gesturing down, and then over the wall, &ldquo;and the ones over there are from Calarasi.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">She says the kids from one camp used to argue with the others - so they built a wall.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better this way,&rdquo; she says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But what happened?</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">She smiles.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better this way.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The woman works on the beach selling cigarette lighters. She used to beg, she says, but not now.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">She shows us her house. One room raised on stilts. Inside is a bed and a giant fridge-freezer. She is proud of this massive appliance, and&nbsp;opens the door to let us see inside. In the freezer section there are piles of plates. On the shelves of the fridges are packets of food. There is no electricity.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t cool them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to keep them away from the rats.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Outside there is a child playing with a water hose. She is wondering why the water is not coming straight out from the spout.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Then she realises there is a hole in the hose, and the water is leaking. She puts her trainer on the hole. It stops. She takes away her foot. The water rushes out in a surge and soaks her trainers. If she puts her trainer on the hole for a longer time, the water pressure builds and a larger spray comes out.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">She jumps through the spray. All her clothes dampen.&nbsp;Then she puts her head on the jet of water, and washes her hair, laughing at the same time.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Fewer than three months after we visited Ponticelli, the camp of&nbsp;Cluj&nbsp;residents, the one of those from Calarasi, and&nbsp;the wall separating the two, were all destroyed by the city of Naples.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Some residents moved to other camps, others went back to Romania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"Coffee morning in August shade: Naples favela\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/4.jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9; width: 700px; height: 466px;\\\"></p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Everyone is a mayor in the camp&rdquo;</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">49 year-old Elena sits in a chair in the middle of her one-room home at the edge of Naples. Her bed to the left. A cabinet in front, and a sink and cooker behind. Every time she makes a small movement - a hand gesture, the turning of her head - she winces in pain. Outside a horse neighs. She lives in a shed near a horse-breeding farm.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A younger woman brings her a phone, announcing her that &ldquo;it has started&rdquo;. From the speaker on her telephone plays the music of a church service. The hypnotic tones of a capella voices in an Orthodox liturgy. Taking place 1,000 kilometres away in Calarasi.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div><iframe align=\\\"middle\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"100\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F291957134&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=400&amp;maxheight=315&amp;callback=jQuery17207387805794708644_1478548139188&amp;_=1478548252941\\\" width=\\\"300\\\"></iframe></div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Two days before, Elena&rsquo;s mother-in-law died. But she could not take the plane from Naples to Romania for the funeral. She is sick with rheumatism.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Everybody told me: &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go there, because you won&rsquo;t see her again?&rsquo;&rdquo; she says. Instead, she attends the funeral by cellphone.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In 2006, Elena first came to Italy, to see &ldquo;how it works&rdquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For 18 years in Romania, Elena had jobs in customs and as a waitress in Pescaru Restaurant opposite the Intercontinental Hotel in central Bucharest. She got married - and divorced - but had a whim, to go to Italy.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;This whim cost me everything,&rdquo; she says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">She had some nephews in Italy, in Villa Literno, a few kilometers from Naples.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s son told me: &lsquo;This life in Italy is not for you, you won&rsquo;t resist it here.&rsquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&lsquo;I will make it!&rsquo; I told him. I can do anything. There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t&rsquo;. That was my slogan.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Elena landed a job picking strawberries. But when she entered the field, bending down, keeping an arched back, she could not do it. After that, she cleaned out stables with her husband, but they lost the job. She went back to Calarasi, but couldn&rsquo;t find work.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">She had no money and no place to go. Her second husband knew some Roma, so they went to live in a settlement camp. The chief of the favela, Mario, promised the couple &lsquo;milk and honey&rsquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But they were paying 150 Euro per month for a shack, plus an extra 17 Euro for electricity. &ldquo;Some people would pay 12 Euro, others nine, depending on the weakness of that person,&rdquo; she says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Most of the people were Roma from Calarasi. The owner would pocket the &lsquo;rent&rsquo; and &lsquo;services&rsquo;. He opened a bar, where he would sell contraband cigarettes for double the price. There he would offer Cognac bought for five Euro from a hypermarket for 15 Euro a bottle. A jar of cucumbers for 89 cents, he would sell for 2.5 Euro.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Sometimes you were pressured to buy, because you would buy on credit,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But that does not mean that they should rip the skin from our flesh.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But when the police arrive - even two or three times a day - the camp boss disappears, says Elena. He closes the bar and hides in his house. &ldquo;He's the head of the camp only when the police are not there,&rdquo; she adds.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When we spoke to residents, they denied that any power structures existed in the camps.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;No one is a boss here,&rdquo; Nita told us about Barra.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When we pushed some men sitting astride a car in Gianturco, they told us the same - in an aggressive tone.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Everyone is a mayor in the camp.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Inside the camp where she stayed, Elena says the people lived from theft and prostitution. They used to collect scrap metal, but not so often anymore.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;They would send their wives to beg and pickpocket,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They would steal phones. Many of them would come to me to try and sell me one. Others would sleep during the day and they would go and take apart the machines and fittings in factories at night, and steal copper wires.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Elena says they come from Calarasi to Naples &ldquo;because they find what they want here. They are accepted, they are allowed to steal, it&rsquo;s favorable for them. If they go elsewhere, they are considered gypsies.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The camps are perceived by Italians as a source of crime. In Barra, if anyone is caught thieving, Nita says he will be forced to leave the camp.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need thieves,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we only need people who are kind and who work.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Pushed on how many people he has expelled, Nita says there was no one.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Some camps have more people in jail than others. The crimes are usually small thefts and robbery with one or two year sentences. In Naples, organised crime among the Roma is non-existent, because they would have to come up <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1240&amp;recType=story\\\">against the mafia clan, the Camorra</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">More of these criminals are now under house arrest. For the judge to sentence home detention, the accused needs to have a rental contract or a property deed.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">So the convicts have to sign in at police station, or the police will come to the camp.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It is strange that the authorities do not recognise the Roma camp as a legal residency, but at the same time allow people there to be under house arrest,&rdquo; says Belfiore. &ldquo;So when it is convenient for state, the camp is legal.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Asked about how this irony can exist, police chief Vincenzo Nicoli argues: &ldquo;House arrest means remaining in a place where the prisoner is traceable, it is not necessarily their residence.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"Calarasi: a European city\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/IMG_1145.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 700px; height: 477px;\\\"></div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Better&nbsp;before the Revolution&rdquo;</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Calarasi is a typical southern Romanian town.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">It has a giant new and expensive civic centre made of glass and steel and sparkling bronze statues of Romanian rulers in its parks - in this case, World War Two leader King Mihai, who is still alive.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Its central streets are clean, and there are lines of shabby shops selling second hand clothes from the UK and Germany.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A taxi driver tells us &ldquo;everything was better under Communism. We had jobs. We had education.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">He is not the only person in town with this opinion.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Niculae Pitigoi is one of the two municipal responsible for the relationship with the Roma community in Calarasi.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">That August morning we stop him on the way to an important rendezvous. He needs to visit a family organising a wedding this week and tell them to keep the music down and prevent the guests from occupying the street, otherwise they will face a fine.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Pitigoi has a notebook where he lists all the weddings planned for 2016, divided by dates. For each of them, he writes a name and a contact number. He calls and tell them nicely to lower the noise. To make sure that the message gets through, he visits each of them.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;They created a discomfort in Calarasi,&rdquo; says Daniel Stancu, the other municipal worker responsible for the Roma. &ldquo;There are two months with weddings every day. People started calling the emergency services and asking: 'What will you do about them? They bother us every night&rsquo;'.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In recent years, spectacular Roma weddings in places such as Calarasi have dazzled the international press: the bride is flown in by helicopter, or the groom turns up in a limousine, the Manelisti (singers) are brought in at prices in the tens of thousands of Euros.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Our predecessors didn't do such weddings,&rdquo; says Stancu.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the early '90s, Calarasi&rsquo;s huge steel factory which hired around 1,500 people, was dismantled, and people couldn't find other jobs. They began to travel to Italy. When they came back, Pi&#539;igoi says: &ldquo;They wanted to show that they did something with their lives&rdquo;. This would mean a wedding, or a car, or a house.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But there is poverty in Calarasi. High unemployment. A low level of literacy. One important task for the town&rsquo;s Roma office is to help people who don't know how to write, so they cannot take care of documents to receive assistance.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;There are people getting sick who don't have money for a prescription and people who are not even paid the minimum wage,&rdquo; says Pi&#539;igoi.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For him, it was better before the Revolution in 1989, as everyone had jobs, and the Romanians and Roma worked together, they got to know each other, and the level of discrimination and the crime rate were lower. He finished high school in 1980 and was hired immediately after. He remembers his first job - where he became 'employee number 1114'.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Communism was the best time [for the Roma], because they were obliged to get a job and go to school. (...) If a Romanian worked and sat down to eat with a Roma, he&nbsp;wouldn't call him 'gypsy' anymore, he would call him by his name.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">There is now a generation of Romanian Roma who have grown up in Italy and speak better Italian than Romanian. Their country is only a place to visit in August - the wedding season.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;You cannot live in Romania,&rdquo; says 20 year-old Andrei, a Roma resident in Rome. &ldquo;You can only work in a field and grow some potatoes and onions, but you cannot make money, you cannot raise a child there.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When we ask all the residents of the shanty-huts if they will go back, we hear the same refrain:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;What is there for me to do in Romania?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The quality of life is higher in Italy than in Romania - even for those living in favelas and at risk of eviction. For Nita, Italy is much cheaper. With ten Euro he can buy food for the entire family. In Romania, this is not possible.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">None of them feel they have opportunities, and the older ones believe the collapse began after Communism fell.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They are nostalgic for the dictator Ceausescu on the other hand, and hopeful about western Europe on the other. But as for their own country today, they have only indifference.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">No one wants to go home there. It is more common for us to meet people who have left Italy to work in Spain or the UK. Most recently there is a wave of Italian-Romanians moving to Los Angeles.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The mayor of Calarasi, Daniel Dragulin, believes more help is needed to improve the situation of Roma from Calarasi. He argues that the situation can be solved only at its source: &ldquo;I said [to the Italians] 'Help us. Invest in Calarasi,&rsquo; which has a massive community in Naples. Instead of spending money with no results [in Italy], support us here.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Since this appeal, little has happened. The two worlds are still separate.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Back in the balmy August afternoon in Naples in the camp of Barra, the fish from the Bulgarians is on the grill. Naked children are still playing in the dust.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">There is no talk of returning home.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Ceausescu used to give you a job,&rdquo; says Nita&rsquo;s wife, Sanda. &ldquo;There were crops, gardens, in Calarasi there was the steel plant, and everybody was working. Now it&rsquo;s all dissolved. The plant is closed. The fields are empty. Calarasi has been bought by the Chinese and the Italians. We stay here because we have nowhere else to go.&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><p>Part of&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/eurocrimes\\\">The Black Sea Eurocrimes</a>&nbsp;project financed by:</p><p><a href=\\\"http://journalismfund.eu/\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/journalismfundlogo.jpg\\\"></a></p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"c9647522-780d-4d41-a92a-5f749c6cb12f\"}]"}, "pk": 1243, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Whoever has more cows, must stay with them for a longer number of days.</p><p>Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe and its economy is based on agriculture. But fruit, wine and vegetables face a constant ban from the Russian market, because of the Government of Moldova&rsquo;s intentions to become closer to the European Union.&nbsp;</p><p>In the villages, the people are leaving for work abroad, the average age is rising, and people are living off subsistence farming. It is estimated that over half of the workforce of Moldova (between 1.2 and two million, from a total population of four million) are working abroad - in construction and cleaning in Russia, Turkey and western Europe.</p><p>25 years after the declaration of independence, the transition of Moldova from pre- to post-Communist has not ended, and&nbsp; the direction of the country is now uncertain.</p><p>The pro-Moscow separatist region of Transnistria, the autonomous Republic of Gaugazia, the powerfully Russophile northern region (around the city of Balti) are compact regions which are not so inclined to move to the west. Diverse ethnicities - Russian, Ukrainian, Gaugaz and different political sympathies have polarized the country in the last year, when a mix of groups flocked onto the streets for the first time with a common aim: the eradication of the mafia and corruption.</p><p>In November 2014, one billion Euro disappeared from the Moldovan banking system - in a case which brought the arrest of the former Prime Minister Vlad Filat and multiple suspicions that an oligarch and backer of many political parties - Vlad Plahotniuc was involved. The protests lasted many days and 10,000s came to the streets.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, these protests have petered out, and calm dominates the streets of towns - a calmness which can become weird after seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when it is very rare to see people on the streets, especially in the provinces.</p><p>In the last few weeks I have jumped in a car and journeyed through Moldova without any target in mind - braving the Autumn gloom and rain.&nbsp;</p><p>I have come in campaign season, before the first vote for the Presidential election. But this could pass by unnoticed, because at the street level this campaign is invisible. &ldquo;There is too little money available for the candidates to campaign,&rdquo; a local photographer told me, &ldquo;the campaign takes place only on Facebook.&rdquo;</p><p>Among the negative records in its possession, Moldova was in 2011, according to Lonely Planet, the country with the fewest number of tourists per year: only 9,000.&nbsp;</p><p>This is partly due to the poor state of the roads, the lack of hotels or a service industry outside the capital. In a small town, there is nothing to see - and you can easily lose a day walking around the streets in the rain. I returned home every night shivering and damp, but with the feeling that I will come back again to the winding streets of Moldova.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This article is also published in Romanian on<a href=\\\"http://www.scena9.ro/article/roadtrip-moldovenesc-petrut-calinescu\\\"> Scena9</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>This report was realised in the structure of the bursary for journalists in the project&nbsp;&ldquo;Support for Journalists fro Romania in approaching the subject of international development&rdquo;&nbsp;implemented by the Federation of Non-Governmental Organisations for Development (FOND).

Most of her adult life was spent behind bars. Ten years split in three sentences. A former drug addict, she had just been&nbsp;diagnosed with&nbsp;HIV. And she was in a dilemma.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I thought it's time to do something with my life,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But at the same time I was thinking: &lsquo;What can I do with my life?&rsquo; I was taking steps towards an honest living. But society was pulling me back.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Friends of Stella invited her to Italy to steal. They wired her money for the trip. As Romania was not part of the EU at that time, they even sent her the paperwork to get through the border control. She left immediately.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The world of petty crime is connected and mobile, says Stela. This&nbsp;is not like other forms of work migration.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If you had a job, and were doing something legal, you would stay in the same place,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But when you're commiting crimes you cannot do that. We weren't stealing only in Italy.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The police never arrested Stela outside of her own country. This was down to her own aptitude in sensing a threat.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I had eyes to my back,&rdquo; she says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Petty theft is based on the circulation of information between informal networks of criminals. Someone would notice a weak spot in policing in a certain town or country, and would suggest a crime that suited the conditions. This could include pickpocketing in the square of a certain Italian city, or on a bus network.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But after two or three months, the cops would notice a pattern of gangs engaging in this crime&nbsp;and would crack down.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Today [one type of crime] is working, tomorrow it's not working anymore,&rdquo; says Stela. &ldquo;If there's nothing to do, you need to leave that place and go somewhere else. And someone would mention Greece, for instance, as a place where it's convenient to steal from ATMs. That's how it works\\\".</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This world is connected mostly via text message and alliances and gangs can be formed and dispersed in a short time.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If I find out that you are good at some sort of method of stealing, I would come to you and propose that we&nbsp;become partners,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You may meet someone right now and start doing a crime together [immediately].&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Like a drug addiction&rdquo;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Take Milan. The Italian hub of finance and fashion was terrorized for three years at the end of the last decade by a gang of children from Craiova, south Romania.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">At that time, researcher at Milan-based agency of social research Codici, Andrea Rampini, studied how the&nbsp;group of 30 kids between eight and 14 years old spent all day pickpocketing in front of the central station, overseen by adult gangmasters. Each of the kids was stealing thousands of Euro per day.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Unlike a freelancer like Stela, this was a mix. Some kids were sold by their relatives to traffickers, others were &ldquo;rented&rdquo; from families, or trafficked from orphanages.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But some teenagers from Oltenia - the region around Craiova - travelled to Italy for the summer to steal in Milan and then came back to school in September with a lot of money.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It was like a summer camp,&rdquo; says Rampini.</p><div>&nbsp;</div><div><p><img alt=\\\"Milan was hit by a wave of kid pickpockets in the late 2000s\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-06%20at%2011.24.39.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Some of the kids were trafficked\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-06%20at%2011.24.16.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 351px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"For many, it offered a high\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-06%20at%2011.22.50%20(1).jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 337px;\\\"></p></div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Pickpocketing all day for a 14 year old girl or boy is like a drug addiction,&rdquo; adds Rampini. &ldquo;They are very excited all the time - and have immediate results of their actions. They can go into shops and buy some clothes or status symbols like trainers. They can eat all day in McDonald&rsquo;s. While in Craiova - they had never been to McDonald&rsquo;s. And now they became something like a rock star.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For Stela, thieving offered a similar sensation.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Stealing gave me a beautiful and pleasing adrenaline,&rdquo; she says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">To justify the crime, she cast herself as a Robin Hood figure.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;'I had something against rich people, who thought they were smarter than the rest of us because they had money,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I would hit them where it hurt them the most, so they would see how it is down here with those suffering next to them. I would take from the rich and give to the poor.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">For Rampini&rsquo;s kids, much of their cash was spent on marriages, which happened when they were teenagers. He says the children shared fantastic tales about weddings, such as how the groom would arrive at the ceremony by limousine - or by a jet plane. Every day in the streets, between stealing from the handbags of passengers or briefcases of businesspeople, the kids were talking about wedding preparations.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;All their lives they had been discriminated in schools, housing and football teams. And now, for the first time, they were the strongest,&rdquo; says Rampini. &ldquo;They wanted to say to the world: &lsquo;I exist, I am not a discriminated poor gypsy boy - I am someone, strong, powerful, beautiful&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Rampini says the gang&nbsp;would move from city to city. This was a Grand Tour - taking in Venice, Turin, Milan and Rome and pickpocketing in the great squares of Italy, and then further afield. Some kids had been in care institutions for children in Holland and Spain, but they had left - or escaped.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Their career, story and paths were very European,&rdquo; says Rampini. &ldquo;They moved around the Schengen zone, and proved that there was no functioning way of co-operating between the social services of different countries.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">There was no dialogue between care institutions Italy,&nbsp;Spain or Holland, and especially with Romania, on the background of problem children.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;These kids,&rdquo; argues Rampini, &ldquo;are more European than European nations.&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But this could not last</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The stories that hit the headlines in the mid-2000s of gypsy thieves from Romania in the tourist hotspots&nbsp;of Rome, Stockholm, Venice, London or Paris are petering out.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The child-trafficking network in Milan was crushed by a joint police operation between cops from Italy and Romania - and the gangmasters were locked up for slavery. The kids were sent back to their families or to social services in Italy - but soon left or escaped the institutions.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Eight years on, some of Rampini&rsquo;s kids returned to Romania, but there were few opportunities for them in Craiova. In Italy, some worked on farms, or collecting scrap iron, one is still studying, another became a pimp, others are married, and some are still on the streets in Milan. For most, their lives have not developed in a stunning direction.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">While Stela was serving her last sentence in a Romanian prison, she used to see convicts leave and return after three days. In the mid-00s, some would come back three times in a row.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Recidivism is high in Romania - although there is no official figure, it is understood to be over 60 per cent.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">One issue is a lack of services inside the jail that help convicts develop skills that sustain them after they leave prison.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The prison system is not built for rehabilitation, but for the control of prisoners,&rdquo; argues professor in criminal justice at the University of Bucharest, Ioan Durnescu. &ldquo;The [system] does not supply education, or advice on how to get jobs.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Prisons in Romania do provide work. Men often labour on construction sites and women manufacture clothes.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;This is good, but this is a way of keeping people under control,&rdquo; says Durnescu. &ldquo;Work should be organised in a way that would support prisoners after release.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Stela says life was tough inside. But outside, it was worse. Ex-cons remain one of the most stigmatised social groups worldwide. This is especially felt in Romania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The mindset where this guy is a former convict, so he will steal from me and I won't hire him&rdquo; is one of the &ldquo;main barriers stopping the reintegration of former convicts&rdquo; in Romania, says Maria Nicoleta Andreescu, executive director at human rights NGO APADOR-CH.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In vocational sectors where ex-cons could get jobs - such as on construction sites or as a taxi driver - anyone with a criminal record risks exclusion.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Almost everyone leaving prison is vulnerable to rejection,&rdquo; adds Durnescu. &ldquo;Society creates a class of exiles from the job market.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They mostly find jobs through families or networks. This makes them vulnerable to being paid cash-in-hand, or joining the hustle economy, where people invent jobs to survive, such as selling flowers or arranging parking spaces. This contributes to the swelling of an underclass.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;We care more about life of dogs on Bucharest streets than people who serve prison sentences,&rdquo; says Durnescu. &ldquo;I see in the media how much a dog in a shelter receives - I have not seen that amount for an ex-prisoner.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The stigma of being an ex-con also creates its own vicious circle - where former prisoners, who have served their time, believe there is no hope for them, and return to crime.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;When all you get from the people around you is negative - of course that makes you bad - people are making you bad,&rdquo; says Stela.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">By preventing access for ex-cons to the local job market, the Romanian Government is tacitly encouraging those with criminal records to seek jobs in the EU, where it is less restrictive for ex-cons to find work.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Around 11,500 Romanians <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/eurocrimes/\\\">are in prison in the EU</a>. This is one third of the size of Romania&rsquo;s own prison population.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not a crime wave - as only one in 256 Romanian abroad are in prison - a proportion the same as Latvia, and <a href=\\\"http://http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1239&amp;recType=story\\\">almost half as many as Lithuania</a>.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But no more than a few hundred of these prisoners have been transferred back to Romanian prisons.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Romanian state is arguably &lsquo;offloading&rsquo; the business of rehabilitation of its own citizens onto its EU neighbours.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This convenient situation&nbsp;was not a planned policy by&nbsp;the authorities.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I would not suspect our government of any strategic decision,&rdquo; says Durnescu. &ldquo;I just think it is careless, [the Government thinks] this group is not important, has no public support, brings no votes, so why should we bother?&rdquo;</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Ex-cons have the capacity, power, intelligence - but they are afraid to make progress&rdquo;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Stela was raised during the Communist regime, in a Roma family from Pitesti, a city west of Bucharest famed for manufacturing cars and automobile parts.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">She saw the Ceausescu dictatorship as the best period of her life, because life was \\\"simple and calm\\\". As a teenager, she had a job in a biscuit factory and she used to make decent cash from small deals, where she bartered with grain and corn. At 14 years of age, she bought her own house.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Revolution brought a shock to this society. Romanians thought the world now opened out for them. They saw opportunities everywhere. Capitalism was imported into Romania. It told everyone they could be rich. They should be rich. That it was good to be rich. But nothing major changed. People were disappointed. So they tried to create their own opportunities - and many turned to crime.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I believe that democracy made people crazy, especially the young,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;What's the advantage in having access to everything, if you - especially as a kid - only see only bad things on TV - that someone raped his sister, or that he tried to kill his brother? In Ceausescu's times you wouldn't have any of that. Maybe these things happened, but they weren't visible.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">So in 2009, Stela pledged to make herself a better person. With the help of an NGO, she quit drugs and started working with former&nbsp;users.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">She opened a car wash where hired ex-convicts and users who couldn't find opportunities elsewhere, and helped them build self-confidence. Some had never experienced paid work in their lives.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">One of her car-washers speaks fluently four languages, but feared making a change in his life.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;A lot of them have the capacity, the power, the intelligence, but they are afraid to make progress,&rdquo; says Stela.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The ex-con is now a social entrepreneur - and has opened a bar and community centre in Ferentari, south Bucharest.

Mostly over 40, with battered baseball caps and grey, dusty jackets, their shoes are beaten-up and their gait slouching.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">They band together on a bench outside the Metro station and opposite the El Portillo bar, where they shout at each other. One from&nbsp;their group stands up and walks along the kerb of the ring-road, checking his phone, and glancing between the heads of people and the sides of vehicles. He is searching for a driver.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">These are drug addicts who collect here every day, waiting for a car - called a<em style=\\\"\\\"> cunda</em> - to take them from the centre of Madrid to the outskirts, where there is a 16 km stretch of road called Ca&ntilde;ada Real, a former trail for cow-herders to move cattle between pastures. In the last two decades, this thoroughfare has seen a boom in shanty-huts and squatters. Every day, users travel by taxi from Madrid to the zone to inject or smoke heroin, before returning to the capital. The <em style=\\\"\\\">cundero </em>- the driver - wants to fill up his cab with as many junkies as he can, so will not move until his car is full.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">We approach the users on the bench, and mention we are from the press. They scream out, stand up and, as a group, race to our side. As we turn to them, they back off, as though we have the power to hurt them with our gaze.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Another man in his 50s, in tattered denim, round glasses and a knotted green necktie ambles up to us. His name is Luis.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;They are scared you have hidden cameras,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This whole place&hellip;&rdquo; he gestures around the shops, along the glass entrance to the Metro, and to our jackets and shirts, &ldquo;... was fitted with hidden cameras.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Luis explains that he was also a former journalist, but no longer. Now he smokes heroin.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">We ask how much the cunda costs.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s five Euro,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You can find out about it on the Internet.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">What about Romanians?

Compared to the other users, when they take drugs, they are more vicious.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">We go off in search of the Romanians. We must access Ca&ntilde;ada Real.

Chickens are snacking on scraps in the dust. A rat is scuttling alongside a wall. The buildings facing the road are formed of breeze blocks covered in white plaster.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Every ten metres the word &lsquo;Kiosco&rsquo; is painted in naive letters next to a small gap in the block, covered in a grill. Below the hatches are written: &lsquo;Refresco, Bocadillo, Patatas&rsquo; with an arrow aimed at the hole.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">On a white wall opposite a car park in giant handwritten letters, pointing to a parking space is the word &lsquo;Estaca&rsquo; - which means &lsquo;stake&rsquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Children walk around in barefeet, playing on smartphones. Facing the road, on red plastic chairs branded with Estrella - the beer of Barcelona - are the men of the Spanish Roma, in tight-fitting t-shirts, with rounded bellies and thick moustaches curled at the end.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Heavy-set women in headscarves, loose-fitting tops, flowery dresses, and with large golden ear-rings step out from the pavement and come up to the car. On the passenger side, one knocks on the window with a strong bang.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I want to talk to you!&rdquo; she shouts. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">We drive on, and more women come out to the road, dressed in the cliched costume of the gypsy.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">We are from Romania, and we think they are Romanian. We make that assumption. But they are not. They are Spanish.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Another woman.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I want to talk to you!&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Another knock.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">We turn onto a car park of cement and pebbles. Cars rattle across the stones - the<em style=\\\"\\\"> cundas</em> - packed with junkies paying five Euro a piece.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">On a hill at the top of the car park is a white-plastered Catholic Church, with a thin and tall wooden cross. Rubbish is piled up on an escarpment to the side. On the ground are flattened miniature cans of Mahou - the beer of Madrid - and a pink toy of the muppet Elmo, covered in white dust.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">I&ntilde;aki&rsquo;s colleague, Carlos, is unloading the vans. Inside are bags of doughnuts, yoghurt, and bottles of lemonade and water.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Users begin to emerge from the street and tents. Some in their 40s or 50s, their bodies wrought tight from decades of injections. They shuffle up, and crowd around the back of the van.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">A man in long black curly hair walks near to us, with sunken cheeks, bulbous muscles in his arms, carrying a cane, and resembling a disabled 70s roadie. He drops a doughnut&nbsp;on the floor, reaches down, picks it up and throws it behind the van. A thin greyhound appears and smells the meat, but leaves it alone.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">A barefoot kid of no more than seven comes up to the van calling out &lsquo;Buenas Tardes&rsquo; in a warm and friendly voice to everyone. He is with his grandfather and a tatty stroller for toddlers. The kid piles the vehicle up with food.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Circling the van is a black woman that everyone calls &lsquo;Mummy&rsquo;. She is in dreadlocks, bent over, her eyes pressed out from her skull. She carries all the food from the van in a Carrefour bag. She could be anywhere between 40 and 80 years old. This happens to people who take heroin and the poison dealers cut it with. No one is sure of her nationality. Someone says a British colony. So we ask in English.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">And she replies with an accent - clear, perfect English with a hint of Creole.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I am from England, Britain,<em style=\\\"\\\"> Inglaterra</em>.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Where are you from in Britain?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I am from London.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Where in London?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">She shouts:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;You are not from London!&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;But where - which borough?&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">She shouts even louder:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;You are not from London!&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Then she shuffles away.</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><img alt=\\\"Zone where anything goes, but tight control by local mafia, and constant oversight from police: Users in Canada Real\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/users%20canada%20real.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 500px; height: 329px;\\\"></div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"If someone tells them they can inject this, they inject it\\\"</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Carlos is an ex-user. With decades of experience. &ldquo;Heroin, amphetamine, everything, I was a <em style=\\\"\\\">politoxic&oacute;mano</em>,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I tried doctors, I went to the mountains to quit drugs, I tried committing suicide. I&ntilde;aki helped me a lot.&rdquo;</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Known as the &lsquo;biggest drugs supermarket in Europe&rsquo;, Ca&ntilde;ada Real is a place where the Madrid police contain the wholesale, retail and consumption of heavy drugs in one place. The police do not arrest people for using, and if they catch people selling, this is a crime. But here, everyone is in business. Wholesalers sell to smaller dealers, who then go to the city to hawk the merchandise. The police pass by in patrol cars every 30 minutes.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Here in Ca&ntilde;ada Real - there is hash, heroin, cocaine,&rdquo; Carlos says. &ldquo;Whatever users can get, they get here. Even rat poison. If someone tells them they can inject this, they inject it. These people are not selective.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Gheorghe is his late 20s, bearded, and in a black jacket and slacks. He is chirpy, talkative, but cannot stop for long. He&rsquo;s from Rahova in south Bucharest. Why is he here?</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I came two and half years ago,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The drugs are better here.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Six Romanians are part of this camp in Valdeming&oacute;mez, while further down the street, away from the drugs zone, is another Romanian village - El Gallinero - whose inhabitants are mainly rubbish pickers and pickpockets.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">In Valdemingomez, Romanians work as &lsquo;employees&rsquo; of the drug dealers. They guard the gate and watch if the police are getting intrusive, shouting back to the dealers if the cops are closing in. It&rsquo;s a frontline job, which means sometimes they go to prison.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Standing in a bandana and sandals, with his feet wrapped in bandages is Ioan, also from Bucharest. Because of an infection, he needs to change the bandages every two days.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I want some trainers,&rdquo; he tells I&ntilde;aki.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">But the priest dismisses the demand. He will not give him any new shoes. Ioan is annoyed. He shouts at himself, like a spurned child.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">We ask if he would like to speak to us.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">He refuses, saying that the press only &ldquo;tell lies&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">He walks around the car park, looking back at us, disappears, then re-emerges at a distance, still observing us, as we observe him.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">I&ntilde;aki tells us that if Ioan receives new trainers, he will only sell them for drugs.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Eventually he walks back over to us - and says he will talk. We sit behind the van and crouch down. He lives by himself in a tent behind the Catholic church. He spends around 30 to 40 Euro per day on heroin.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I get money for drugs mostly from selling the new syringes from an organization, in return for the old ones, which I collect from the ground,&rdquo; he says.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">He tried to quit at some point, and went to a rehab centre, but when he failed to stay clean, they kicked him out.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">He has contracted Hepatitis C. It flared up at some point.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;But now I&rsquo;m healed,&rdquo; he believes.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Ioan arrived in Spain in 2001, with his sister and sister-in-law.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I wasn't using back then, I was playing sports,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;First we lived in Barcelona and started with cocaine and heroin. But soon we didn't have any money for rent, so I started stealing.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The police arrested him for thieving in Barcelona, where he was tried and convicted. The Spanish authorities sent him back to Romania. In 2008, he was caught again for pickpocketing. He spent three years in jail in Romania.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;As soon as I got out of prison, I came back to Spain. I don&rsquo;t have many relatives in Bucharest: two of my brothers died - one because of drugs. I have one sister in Germany, and another in England. But I found a place here, in Valdeming&oacute;mez.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">A patrol car moves into the park. It passes by a cunda moving in the opposite direction. Two young cops are seated up front. The car stops, and the policeman get out and start talking to some men standing up against a wall.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;The Spanish police are fine,&rdquo; says Ioan. \\\"If you respect them, they will respect you.\\\"</p><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If you had an overdose, the people would rob you&rdquo;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Fewer users are coming to the van for the food. The&nbsp;doughnuts and the lemonade have gone. Only some water and yoghurt is left.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">There is time to ask I&ntilde;aki about how he switched from heroin abuse to providing snacks to a united nations of addicts in the suburbs of Madrid.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">I&ntilde;aki started using because he &ldquo;liked it&rdquo;. Mostly heroin and cocaine. His first marriage failed because of drugs, and soon he ended up living under a bridge with a new wife in Torregrosa, a Madrid hub in the 80s and 90s for dealing.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It was worse than this place,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Every day, three or four people would die. There - if you had an overdose, instead of helping you, the people would rob you.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Inaki would steal bags, break into pharmacies and traffic in drugs.

I&ntilde;aki doesn&rsquo;t give details about how the man looked, or how he spoke, but he does remember the words distinctly. This is what he said:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Do you love your wife? Do you know the difference between desire and love? God is love and God loves you. If you love your wife, you want to be happy with her, and if you love your wife, you want her to be happy with you.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">One year later he was still living under the bridge with his wife, on a mattress infected with lice.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;At that moment, I felt I had wasted my whole life and that I would not change because I was a drug addict.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Then the words of the man he met on the street came back to him. At the same time he recalled a verse from The Bible, Matthew 7:7. \\\"Ask and it will be given to you: seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">That night he and his wife lit candles either side of their mattress. Then they binged on drugs. They were convinced it would be the last night of their lives. I&ntilde;aki screamed and asked God for help.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;I felt my heart suddenly fill with the love of God. Sweet, pure and sublime tenderness. My life flashed before my eyes. I did not feel condemned, but loved by God. I spent two hours lying there. It was a new kind of high.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">That morning he and his wife checked into separate rehab clinics. They kept in touch once a month via the telephone.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;People ask me: &lsquo;You were on drugs, you do not think that this was a hallucination?&rsquo; I said: &lsquo;My life changed, I do not take drugs. I do not go into this place...&rdquo; he gestures to the tents and favelas of Valdeming&oacute;mez... &ldquo;as a buyer, but I go to help. I do not meet these people as a user, but to give food.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">For three decades, the organisation he works for - Remar - has been coming here to donate food.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Spain&rsquo;s financial collapse of 2008 did not affect Ca&ntilde;ada Real, says I&ntilde;aki.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;Here people do crime for a living,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There is no crisis here.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Now he sees different generations of drug addicts - the older Spanish and Latin American users, some from other colonies, and the younger ones, including those from Romania, Ukraine and Bulgaria, as well as Moroccans and Algerians, many of whom start using when they come to Spain.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">&ldquo;It is worse for those who have been doing this for 30 or 40 years, many don&rsquo;t have inner strength like me.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Dusk. The air is dusty. Night comes fast in September. The sound of a muezzin calls from over the escarpment. I ask if there is a mosque nearby. I&ntilde;aki says there is one. I look over the edge of ridge. A group of tents. The melody is louder. The call to prayer is from a radio.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Some men in their 30s are standing up against a plaster wall in the car park. One of them picks up a door from a rubbish tip. He moves over to the remains of a charred bonfire at the edge of the car park. He throws the door down. Then he walks back over to the rubbish tip and picks up another door. He places this on its side, and leans the first door against it. He takes a flask and pours on some gasoline, clicks open a lighter, and watches the flames flare up.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Ten metres away another bonfire explodes into the air.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Further away in the distance the sparks of another fire can be seen.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"\\\">This is the signal that they are selling.</p><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em style=\\\"\\\">Also published in Romanian on <a href=\\\"http://casajurnalistului.ro/taxi-spre-o-noua-doza/\\\">Casa Jurnalistului </a>and in Spanish on <a href=\\\"http://www.bez.es/578682215/Los-nuevos-yonquis-vienen-del-Este.html\\\">Bez.es</a></em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><p style=\\\"\\\"><em style=\\\"\\\">Part of&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/eurocrimes\\\" style=\\\"\\\">The Black Sea Eurocrimes</a>&nbsp;project financed by:</em></p><p style=\\\"\\\"><a href=\\\"http://journalismfund.eu/\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/journalismfundlogo.jpg\\\"></a></p></div><div>&nbsp;</div><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"f960861a-dcfa-476f-8cc5-b46168754f67\"}]"}, "pk": 1247, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

This was run by its namesake legend - an ex-attacking midfielder for Barcelona, Real Madrid and Galatasaray known as 'Regele' in Romania. The King.&nbsp;</p><p>But Manea was fresh - and had played only five games for Hagi&rsquo;s local side, Viitorul Constanta. His selection for Romania was a surprise.</p><p>Three weeks later, on 23 June 2014, the boy was transferred from Viitorul in Romania to Cypriot club Apollon Limassol for 2.5 million Euro.</p><p>Apollon Limassol is one of the larger clubs from a small footballing nation. The club has a line in purchasing&nbsp;the most talented players from countries with a more glittering heritage, such as Romania and Serbia.</p><p>The 2.5 million figure was high for a Cypriot club for an underage player. More strange was that, at the time of the transfer, Manea was valued at 300,000 Euro by comprehensive football website TransferMarkt.</p><p>Even more strange was that&nbsp;this deal took place in secret. There was no public announcement. Manea continued to play for Viitorul as though such a huge&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;for such a young player&nbsp;had never happened.</p><p>And a month before the deal, on 15 May 2014, we can now reveal that Viitorul, represented by Hagi as chairman, signed a mysterious agreement with an offshore company in Malta, Dito Trading and Consulting Limited, represented by &ldquo;director&rdquo; Karl Schranz and the German FIFA agent Thorsten Weck.</p><p>From documents in the Football Leaks trove, it appears Viitorul offered a deal to the Maltese company based to &ldquo;evaluate&ldquo; the transfer of Manea's rights from Viitorul.</p><p>At that time, Hagi&rsquo;s club acknowledged &ldquo;Dito has introduced Viitorul to Apollon Limassol&rdquo; and &ldquo;assisted Viitorul successfully to sell the rights&rdquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Virtually invisible in football&rdquo;</div></div><div><p>Yet Dito is an invisible company which has no real footprint in the transfer or consultancy market. In the Football Leaks data of 18.6 million documents, its name only appears once. It has no website. It has no reputation.</p><p>In exchange for this evaluation of the transfer, Hagi accepted to pay the firm the difference of any sum over 1.5 million Euro from the transfer of Manea.</p><p>At the moment of his sale, Hagi&rsquo;s academy had debts of 19.4 million lei (approximately 4.4 million Euro), and the money from Cyprus could allow Hagi to pay off part of this cash and fund the development of other young players.&nbsp;</p><p>When Apollon offered Viitorul 2.5 million for Manea, he was obliged&nbsp;to send to Malta&nbsp;40 per cent of the transfer amount he received. A cool million.</p><p>According to FIFA studies at that time, the average commission paid by clubs to agents for international transfers was around \\\"28 per cent of the value of the transaction\\\".</p><p>And this was only a consulting fee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Cristian Manea played five games for Viitorul Constanta, before being called up to the national side\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/_CPR1516%20Cristian%20Manea.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 900px; height: 599px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Who received the money?</div></div><div><p>Karl Schranz is the Dito Trading and Consulting Limited director who signed 'The Manea Agreement&rsquo;. He&nbsp;is also listed as head of the Account Department for the Maltese company E&amp;S Consultancy Limited.</p><p>This firm is based in the same town as Dito Trading in Malta - St. Julians. A trained accountant, Schranz advises and assists in all Malta Financial Service Authority (MFSA) license processes, &lsquo;igaming&rsquo; and corporate finance.</p><p>Thorsten Weck is a football intermediary who owns a company, Thorsten Weck Sportmanagement, headquartered in Dusseldorf. He is not a major league agent. His portfolio includes a few average German players, some youngsters with Turkish origins and a couple of Uruguayans. His best player was 22-year-old German national player Max Meyer (value according to transfermarkt: 16 million Euro), whom he lost to Rogon, a major player in the Bundesliga.</p><p>The allegation is that these men are just a front. However neither Weck nor Schranz replied to interview questions. The key to the real owner of Dito may be hidden behind Dito Trading and Consulting Limited address:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>116/8 San Juan, St. George&rsquo;s Road, St. Juans STJ 3203, Malta</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the same address used by Lian Sports Limited, the offshore sports management controlled by controversial businessman Abdilgafar &ldquo;Fali&rdquo; Ramadani, which&nbsp;acquires \\\"highly skilled talents\\\"&nbsp;in the Balkans, according to its website.</p><p>The same St Julians address also appears in a 100,000 Euro &ldquo;commission&rdquo; contract signed by Portuguese club Benfica and Lian Sports Limited, following the transfer of Serbian talent Luka Jovic from Red Star Belgrade to Portugal, also via Apollon Limassol, discovered by Football Leaks.</p><p>A Macedonian of Albanian origin who hates to be photographed, Ramadani did not have an agent&rsquo;s license at the moment of Manea&rsquo;s transfer, an essential condition in the summer of 2014.</p><p>At that time, Weck had a FIFA license obtained by the German federation, a reason which allowed him to sign the contract of the &lsquo;evaluation&rsquo; of the Manea transfer.</p><p>Ramadani&rsquo;s name does not appear in the Football Leaks documents linked to Viitorul and Apollon. It never appears on any contract or agreement. Instead, the signature for Lian Sports comes from the former goalkeeper of Partizan Belgrade, Nikola Damjanac, who is the Macedonian&rsquo;s partner at Lian Sports.</p><p>In the German media, Ramadani has been associated with the Albanian brothers Bashkim and Burim Osmani, suspected by the German secret service of involvement in a criminal network and&nbsp;drug-trafficking in Hamburg.</p><p>Now Lian Sports represents Stefan Jovetic (Inter Milan), Adem Ljajic (Torino) and Marcos Alonso (Chelsea).</p><p>Meanwhile Apollon Limassol is a club where Israeli super-agent Pini Zahavi holds influence. Now in his early 70s, Zahavi is known as the man who introduced Roman Abramovich to Chelsea, and Ramadani is one of his associates in eastern Europe. In&nbsp;Football Leaks, he refers to 'Fali' as &ldquo;my guy&rdquo; in a February 2014 email.</p><p>Practically, the Zahavi-linked club Apollon Limassol paid 2.5 million Euro for a player, but in just 48 hours, figures close to Zahavi's network&nbsp;recouped one million Euro of that amount back to Malta through a &ldquo;consultancy&rdquo; agreement.</p><p>And both transactions were made using the Romanian bank account of the now 51 year-old Hagi.</p><p>Everyone concerned appears to be close. According to sources at Gazeta Sporturilor, Ramadani and Hagi met a few times in Palma, on the island of Mallorca, one of the locations where the Macedonian has made his home after leaving his business from Germany.</p><p>In the Football Leaks documents, in January 2015, an agent from Lian Sports proposes the five &ldquo;the biggest talents&rdquo; in the Balkans to a Portuguese club. Players from Academia Hagi are among them.</p><p>The agent makes the approach after the vice-president of the Portuguese club has been in conversation with &lsquo;Fali and Pini&rsquo;. This is&nbsp;a certain reference to Ramadani and Zahavi.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Manea: the Cyprus player who never was</div><p>Despite a 2.5 million Euro move to Apollon Limassol, Manea never went to the club. Nor did he even visit the Mediterranean island.</p><p>&ldquo;Cristi never went to Cyprus,&rdquo; says a member of Manea&rsquo;s family.</p></div><div><p>Instead he stayed in Constanta, Romania. The transfer move was arguably not intended to sell the 'player' Manea to Apollon Limassol, but only his &lsquo;rights'.</p><p>This activity - known as Third Party Ownership - is now forbidden under FIFA regulations, as it gives a third party influence over a player&rsquo;s future, independent of his club and his own sporting will.</p><p>However clubs can get around the new rule&nbsp;by selling a player &ldquo;on paper&rdquo; to one club, even though he may be destined for another location.</p><p>One year later, the teenager unwittingly finds himself in another scandal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Manea: the Chelsea player who never was</div></div><div><p>On June 11 2015 at 9:12pm BST, news agency Reuters announced that the 17 year-old Romanian protege Cristian Manea had signed for Chelsea FC.</p><p>This was picked up by newspapers such as L&rsquo;Equipe, Gazzetta dello Sport, The Independent and the Daily Express, who published the story, using information from the Romanian media, leaked from Hagi&rsquo;s entourage.</p><p>The prospect of a move to Chelsea wasn&rsquo;t new. A few months earlier, in March 2015, the Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio announced on his Twitter account that Hagi had agreed a 3.1 million Euro transfer to Chelsea for his player.</p><p>Even the makers of the bestselling video game Football Manager included Manea in Chelsea&rsquo;s squad for the 2015/16 season.</p><p>Speaking on a Romanian TV channel after the news of the transfer to Chelsea went public, Viitorul's general director Cristian Bivolaru was asked about the move to the London club:</p><p>&ldquo;Manea's transfer is done,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>But he added a cavaet that lacked clarity.</p><p>&ldquo;His destination is still under discussion.&rdquo;</p><p>Was he to be sold to Chelsea and then put out on loan? The dream of walking through the tunnel of&nbsp;Stamford Bridge was fading.</p><p>&ldquo;It seems that [the destination] will be [Belgian club] Mouscron. We wanted to keep the player more, but that was part of the deal.&rdquo;</p><p>A month later, in June 2015, the website of Academia Hagi carried no information on one of its brightest talents moving to one of the world's biggest clubs.</p><p>Chelsea also published no details of the transaction - nor did it make an announcement or denial. The summer passed and Manea ended up at Mouscron. On its webpage, the Belgian club confirmed the talented Romanian defender was on loan&hellip;</p><p>But on loan from Chelsea.</p><p>Of course, this was not true. Manea was never sold to Chelsea. He wasn't even part of Viitorul Constanta at that time. He was still signed to Apollon Limassol.</p><p>So Reuters published news about the transfer of a player between two clubs, one of which did not own him, and the other which never&nbsp;planned to own him.</p><p>But the headline news should have helped increase the market value of the player - and the interest of other clubs.</p><p>Now Manea remains in Belgium, where he has made only seven appearances for the Mouscron team. Many top footballers from Lian Sports have passed to Apollon and&nbsp;made their way to Mouscron, a club which has in its council of administration Gil Zahavi and Adar Zahavi, the son and the nephew of the Israeli impresario.</p><p>The patron of Academia Hagi refused to respond to ten questions which we sent on 23 November. The next Sunday, we received a short message stating that &ldquo;we remind you&rdquo; that we have &ldquo;already offered our point of view&rdquo; - in reference to an earlier story on the matter.

Just a week and a half earlier, the German player had helped his country win a World Cup victory in Brazil and, finally, he could leave the circus that came with the championship behind him. It was time to put up his feet.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I'm enjoying my vacation in Las Vegas,&rdquo; &Ouml;zil wrote to his millions of Twitter followers, posting a selfie in which he looked like he&rsquo;d had a long night.</p><p>&Ouml;zil's trip to the US produced several paparazzi photos that appeared in Bild am Sonntag, a German tabloid, and showed the star snuggling up with his partner Mandy Capristo.&nbsp;</p><p>In one of the intimate photos taken near the pool of a luxury hotel, they both had similar highlights in their hair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;They are obviously streaks of luck,&rdquo; wrote the paper. &Ouml;zil didn't know at the time that on that summer day more than two years ago &ndash; a moment when he had reached the apex of his career &ndash; that his streak of luck was coming to an end.</p><p>He had come under the scrutiny of Spanish tax officials. The tax office was interested in his personal earnings from 2011 to 2013, when &Ouml;zil had been playing for Real Madrid.</p><p>For more than a year and a half, his lawyers and tax advisors in Madrid and M&uuml;lheim an der R&uuml;hr in Germany tried to thwart the persistent investigation pursued by the Madrid authorities, the Agencia Tributaria, and rebut its claims. At the start of this year, the Spanish tax authorities ordered the German national team player to pay back-taxes and a penalty payment in the millions. &Ouml;zil appealed the decision.</p><p>It could have been worse. His tax advisor, as internal emails make clear, was also relieved that their client had managed to narrowly avoid criminal proceedings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;&Ouml;zil had not submitted earnings records to Madrid&rdquo;</div><p>The assessment produced by the tax authorities partly reads like they are reckoning with a tax evader who had tried to take them for a ride. According to the documents, &Ouml;zil had not submitted earnings&nbsp;records to Madrid for his income tax return for either 2012 or 2013.</p><p>&ldquo;The taxpayer was aware of his tax liability, or at least he should have known,&rdquo; reads one document. &ldquo;It is a fundamental requirement that every taxpayer is aware of, even those with only elementary financial knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Another part of the document speaks of a &ldquo;serious violation&rdquo; and of a &ldquo;cover-up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Mesut &Ouml;zil's transfer from Werder Bremen to Real Madrid in the summer of 2010 catapulted him to become one of the top-earning football professionals in Europe. In the six-year contract &Ouml;zil signed on Aug. 18, 2010, his new club guaranteed him gross earnings of 8,771,930 Euro (at current exchange rates, 9.6 million USD) per year.</p><p>The transfer was also extremely profitable for &Ouml;zil's agent at the time, Reza Fazeli, as a result of a deal he had also signed with Real Madrid on 18 August 2010. Spiegel obtained documentation of this via the whistleblowing platform Football Leaks, along with records from &Ouml;zil's tax file.</p><p>According to the deal, the Madrid club was to pay the agent a finder's fee of 1.5 million Euro by 5 September 2010. Furthermore, Real committed to paying Fazeli 600,000 Euro annually for the remaining five-years of &Ouml;zil's contract. In total, Fazeli earned 4.5 million Euro for a couple of negotiating sessions and a few signatures. &Ouml;zil came out even better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;&Ouml;zil promised guaranteed minimum net annual salary of eight million Euro at Arsenal&rdquo;</div><p>In late Summer 2013, FC Arsenal said it would buy &Ouml;zil from Real Madrid. On 2 September, the player signed several contracts with the Premier League club. &ldquo;Addendum 2&rdquo; of his five-year employment contract focuses on money: Mesut &Ouml;zil is earning a base salary in London of 10.2 million Euro through June 30, 2018.</p><p>For each season that Arsenal qualifies for the group stage of the Champions League, he will receive an extra 1.8 million Euro. Furthermore, Arsenal agreed to pay its prominent newcomer a signing bonus of six million Euro, payable in five tranches of 1.2 million Euro per year.</p><p>But that wasn't all.</p><p>In a supplementary agreement, Arsenal promised &Ouml;zil a &ldquo;guaranteed minimum&rdquo; net annual salary of 8,077,000. That&rsquo;s roughly what Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn, at the time the best-paid CEO of a company listed on Germany's blue-chip stock index (DAX), earned in 2013 after taxes. To reach this total, FC Arsenal signed another contract with a d&uuml;sseldorf-based company that owns the football professional's publicity rights. The name of the company: &Ouml;zil Marketing GmbH.</p><p>The deal foresees Arsenal paying an additional 1,476,095 Euro per year until June 2018 into an &Ouml;zil Marketing account at Deutsche Bank in D&uuml;sseldorf. In return, the club was allowed to use its new star for marketing purposes for the duration of his contract.</p><p>&Ouml;zil Marketing GmbH, headquartered on K&ouml;nigsallee in D&uuml;sseldorf, was founded on 18 September&nbsp;2008. At that time, the young professional athlete, who was still playing for FC Schalke 04 at the time, and had not yet relocated to Bremen, transferred all of his global marketing rights to the new company. Anyone wanting to use &Ouml;zil in a ad campaign would have to sign a contract with &Ouml;zil Marketing. And several did. Sporting goods firm Nike, for example, paid 300,000 Euro a year to &Ouml;zil&rsquo;s company in 2011 and 2012.</p><p>But all of those deals are peanuts compared to what Nike&rsquo;s competitor, Adidas, has been paying &Ouml;zil Marketing for almost the last four years.</p><p>In 2013, Adidas International Marketing B.V., headquartered in Amsterdam, signed a contract with &Ouml;zil's company that is supposed to run until the end of June 2020. This deal, which will make the young man from Gelsenkirchen into a global Adidas icon, could earn him around 16 million Euro. The additional 75,000 Euro that Adidas sent over as a bonus for the 2014 World Cup victory in Brazil was just a small cherry on top.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;&Ouml;zil didn't show up to summons&rdquo;</div><p>It appears that until mid-2014, Spanish tax authorities had no awareness of these millions that Mesut &Ouml;zil moved around, in his own name, between 2011 and 2013. &Ouml;zil's tax returns had apparently failed to provide precise information, explanations or documentation. That led the Agencia Tributaria to issue a summons calling for the football star to appear at the agency's offices on 5 September, 2014 for a tax audit.</p><p>&Ouml;zil didn't show up. Neither did his Spanish tax advisors. They only replied five days after the scheduled appointment, assuming that an email would suffice. That was their first mistake. Their next one was to use the familiar form of &ldquo;you&rdquo; in the email to the tax office official &ndash; a woman who, as became clear in correspondence over the ensuing months, was to become a serious thorn in &Ouml;zil's side.</p><p>By the end of September, they wanted everything on the table: &Ouml;zil's contract with Real Madrid and Arsenal; the corresponding addenda and supplementary agreements; all agreements pertaining to his advertising rights; income stemming from property ownership; a declaration regarding his global assets; comprehensive data pertaining to all his bank accounts and investment income.</p><p>Mesut &Ouml;zil involved two tax accounting firms: One of them was based in M&uuml;lheim an der Ruhr. The other, called Senn Ferrero and based in Madrid, represents numerous clients from the world of entertainment and sports, including many Real Madrid players. The Spanish company was responsible for correspondence with Spanish officials while the German company was tasked with collecting the requested documents and information and having it translated into Spanish. It appears to have been a chaotic collaboration. On 30 September&nbsp;2014, a Senn Ferrero accountant met with the relevant tax inspector for an initial hearing, but was unable to deliver the extensive documentation that had been requested several weeks previously. The Germans hadn't even sent over &Ouml;zil's employment contract with Real Madrid.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Please bear in mind that the failure to provide this documentation will derive in strong penalties for Mr. MO. &rdquo; the Senn Ferrero representative wrote to the tax accountants in M&uuml;lheim the next day.&nbsp;</p><p>If the patience of the Spanish tax authorities is pushed too far, he wrote, they could &ldquo;adopt a much more aggressive attitude in the procedure, even to convert the procedure into a criminal matter under several requirements.&rdquo;</p><p>In a mail to an executive at Senn Ferrero, the lawyer was even clearer.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This isn't looking good. The inspector was astonished by our thin documentation. The office in Germany is extremely slow and I have the impression that they are completely clueless when it comes to tax issues.&rdquo;</p><p>A bit more than a month later, it happened again. The Senn Ferrero representative met with the tax inspector for the third time and, again, the Germans apparently hadn't come through.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It is worrisome with these people,&rdquo; he wrote in an email to his boss. &ldquo;They sent us a poor and incomplete translation of the contracts. We are going to present a wretched image when we meet with the tax agent on November 20.&rdquo;</p><p>It took around a year before it became clear which payments and money transfers the Spanish tax authorities were most interested in. One main focus were the two payments of 600,000 Euro each that &Ouml;zil's then-agent Reza Fazeli had received from Real Madrid in 2011 and 2012. The tax authority was of the opinion that &Ouml;zil, and not the football club, should have been responsible for paying his agent the fee for the transfer from Werder Bremen to Real Madrid. The Spanish tax authorities were demanding that &Ouml;zil retroactively pay income tax on this money as well. After all, Fazeli had performed his services on behalf of &Ouml;zil and not for Real. In &Ouml;zil's employment contract with Real, the agent had placed his signature next to &Ouml;zil's and not next to the team's. Furthermore, Fazeli had for several years held power of attorney at &Ouml;zil Marketing GmbH. The tax authority saw Real's payment of the agent as an income advantage for &Ouml;zil, on which he was required to pay taxes.</p><p>The Spanish tax authorities used the same rationale when it came to fees of 1.47 million Euro paid to his subsequent agent, Erkut S&ouml;g&uuml;t, in September 2013 linked to &Ouml;zil's transfer from Real Madrid to FC Arsenal. In that case, the money was paid to the agent by Arsenal.</p><p>&ldquo;We have bad news,&rdquo; &Ouml;zil's tax advisors from Senn Ferrero wrote to their counterparts in Germany after the tax inspector demanded in March 2015 to see additional documentation pertaining to the player's transfer to London.</p><p>To protect &Ouml;zil's 2013 income from the clutches of the Spanish tax authorities, Senn Ferrero worked together with a London tax accountant's office to search for a loophole. They argued that the football star, following his move to Britain in September 2013, was also liable for taxation there, because the tax year starts in Britain on April 6. A 26-page rental agreement was submitted in support of this interpretation. The contract made clear that &Ouml;zil had rented a mansion in the north of London for two years at a cost of 9,000 GBP per week following his transfer to Arsenal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Image rights company &ldquo;under tax authorities&rsquo; focus&rdquo;</div><p>But the Spanish authorities remained firm. &Ouml;zil, they argued, didn't move from Madrid to London in April, May or June, but rather at the beginning of September 2013 and had thus spent more than half the year in Spain. He was therefore required to declare his 2013 earnings in Spain.</p><p>The tax inspectors, however, were especially interested in &Ouml;zil Marketing GmbH, where &Ouml;zil&rsquo;s publicity earnings had landed. Companies that market the publicity rights of football stars are often covers for holding companies based in tax havens.</p><p>But there is no shell company behind &Ouml;zil Marketing GmbH. The agency is headquartered in D&uuml;sseldorf and Mesut &Ouml;zil is the sole owner. His brother Mutlu has been company director since October 2013, when he took over from &Ouml;zil's father Mustafa.</p><p>It isn't surprising that the Madrid tax authorities wanted to get their hands on a share of the significant amounts of money &Ouml;zil Marketing GmbH had made prior to his 2013 move. But &Ouml;zil's Spanish tax advisors were able to successfully ward off the demand. To do so they presented a paper notarized in D&uuml;sseldorf documenting an out-of-court settlement totaling in the millions between Mesut &Ouml;zil and his father.</p><p>Mustafa &Ouml;zil, 49, had been the director of &Ouml;zil Marketing since its founding in September 2008. Indeed, he had been at his son's side since the beginning of his professional career. &Ouml;zil's father enjoyed the spotlight: His company car was a Ferrari and he liked to hold business meetings in Breidenbacher Hof, a luxury D&uuml;sseldorf hotel where a litre of mineral water costs 11.5&nbsp;Euro. When things got complicated, &Ouml;zil's father preferred to seek outside help, hiring expensive lawyers. As a result, the company's expenses grew out of control. In 2012, &Ouml;zil Marketing spent 227,459.69 Euro on legal and consulting fees. In 2013, that sum grew to 251,497.96 Euro.</p><p>In October 2013, the father and son had a surprising &ndash; for the public, at least &ndash; falling out. Mesut demoted his father and, in October 2013, appointed his brother Mutlu to replace him. A few weeks later, Mustafa &Ouml;zil then received a termination notice, effective immediately. Mesut &Ouml;zil's father responded by filing a civil suit with a d&uuml;sseldorf court.</p><p>He demanded &ldquo;commission payments on the basis of a variable compensation agreement&rdquo; &ndash; in other words, a significant share of the sponsorships that he had finalized on behalf of his son as the head of &Ouml;zil Marketing. In response, Mesut demanded the return of a private 915,000-Euro loan and confiscated the registration of his company car, a Ferrari F458.</p><p>The conflict threatened to become a public mudslinging contest, with both sides countersuing. But before the planned 19 November 2014 hearing at the D&uuml;sseldorf regional court over the family&rsquo;s row, Mesut and his father reached an out-of-court settlement at the beginning of October.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"Explosive\\\" secret contract</div><p>The secret contract, certified by a D&uuml;sseldorf notary public, is seven pages long &ndash; and explosive. Newspapers reported at the time that Mustafa &Ouml;zil had sued his son&rsquo;s marketing company for unpaid commissions on deals with sporting goods companies companies and advertising contracts to the tune of 630,000 Euro. But 630,000 Euro is a laughable figure in this case.</p><p>The fact is that &Ouml;zil Marketing GmbH committed itself to paying Mustafa &Ouml;zil a severance package worth 8.1 million Euro, payable in two tranches within six months by March 31, 2015. Plus, he got back the key for the Ferrari.</p><p>It was an odd settlement. Why would &Ouml;zil suddenly agree to provide his father with compensation that would consume around half of the revenues expected from his multimillion-euro deal with Adidas that would run until 2020? And why did the notary public explicitly distance himself from the 8.1-million-Euro deal, by stating he was neither familiar with the content of the suits and countersuits pending in court nor the amount that Mustafa &Ouml;zil had originally demanded?</p><p>Neither Mesut &Ouml;zil, his father nor his brother Mutlu, as head of &Ouml;zil Marketing GmbH, provided comment on these questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;&Ouml;zil&rsquo;s compensation to father a deductible expense&rdquo;</div><p>But this mysterious deal did in fact help the national team member with his tax audit in Madrid, which had already been active for more than two months at the time he reached the 8.1-million Euro deal with his father. That, at least, is how a senior Senn Ferrero employee describes it in an email.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the mail, the Spanish tax authorities ceased further investigation into &Ouml;zil Marketing GmbH after receiving documentation of the millions of Euro in compensation paid to &Ouml;zil&rsquo;s father because, as the internal mail states, the tax authorities considered the settlement to be a &ldquo;deductible expense.&rdquo;</p><p>But Agencia Tributaria remained unforgiving on other points, particularly when it came to the 1.2 million Euro in fees paid by Real Madrid to &Ouml;zil's then-agent Fazeli and the 1.47 million Euro fee paid by FC Arsenal to his new agent Erkut S&ouml;g&uuml;t. They determined these figures to be payment in kind for the German national team player. &Ouml;zil's Spanish tax accountants wrote a rebuttal to the tax office in which they questioned the legality of the demand. But they also were aware that their client was going to avoid the worst.</p><p>&ldquo;We successfully managed to prevent the tax investigation from becoming a criminal investigation,&rdquo; a Senn Ferrero accountant wrote proudly to &Ouml;zil's tax advisors in Germany. To demonstrate that such a threat had been imminent, he attached two articles from the Spanish daily El Pa&iacute;s about the tax problems facing Argentinian national player Javier Mascherano, who plays for FC Barcelona.</p><p>&ldquo;Criminal proceedings will likely be introduced against Mascherano,&rdquo; the Senn Ferrero accountant wrote to his German counterparts, but &ldquo;for sums that are a lot lower than those of MO.&rdquo;</p><p>Mesut &Ouml;zil&rsquo;s father Mustafa did not respond to requests for comment on the questions. Citing tax privacy laws, a media lawyer representing Mesut &Ouml;zil and his firm &Ouml;zil Marketing GmbH threatened to take legal action against Spiegel if it published the content of &ldquo;alleged information&rdquo; that had been &ldquo;obtained through a hacker attack on the Spanish accounting firm Senn Ferrero in April 2016&rdquo; and reported the facts incorrectly.</p><p>The lawyer also stated that there is no investigation and there are no criminal proceedings relating to Mesut &Ouml;zil in Spain.</p><p>On 5 February&nbsp;2016, Senn Ferrero received an official notification according to which Mesut &Ouml;zil had to pay 2,017,152.18 Euro in back taxes, including late payment interest. On 7 March, the tax agents sent another notification to the Spanish tax accountants, this time regarding the penalty being levied: 796,963.36 Euro. &Ouml;zil first paid his tax debt of over two million Euro. Initially, the penalty was lifted after &Ouml;zil submitted an appeal on 8 March.</p><p>Neither his tax lawyers in Madrid nor in M&uuml;lheim would comment on the further proceedings. &Ouml;zil&rsquo;s media lawyer stated that there is only a civil proceeding that the player is pursuing on his own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read more at our <a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/football-leaks/\\\">Football Leaks</a> page</strong></p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"69564e34-f232-4084-b191-27f80e55d4b8\"}]"}, "pk": 1253, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

He is being pursued by the largest European football clubs and the most powerful agents &ndash; and is constantly on the run because so many have so much to fear, for their money and their secrets. But there he is, sitting as a fan in the stands of Hamburg's football stadium. He calls himself John and is holding his fifth beer. On the pitch, Hamburger SV is once again losing badly. The away fans are chanting: &ldquo;Second division! Hamburg is coming!&rdquo;</p><p>John laughs. He is still able to, despite everything.</p><p>He can still enjoy football. He can scream and cheer &ndash; and can lose himself in the excitement inside the stadium. And yet, he is the one who has shaken up the glittering world of professional football &ndash; the one who has exposed the sport's unscrupulous, corrupt and greedy underbelly to the public.</p><p>John is Football Leaks, the online platform that has exposed a series of explosive contracts and agreements from within the football industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Data: the equivalent of 500,000 Bibles&rdquo;</div><p>The game has come to an end and the Hamburg fans rain down boos and whistles on their team. John stands up and takes one more sip of beer. That's enough fun for now. It's time to get back to work. John has come to Hamburg to support Spiegel as it evaluates his dataset.</p><p>In Spring 2016, John decided to share his secret Football Leaks treasure. He no longer wanted to merely publish a player contract here and disclose a bank account statement there. He instead wanted to show the public how everything fit together: the well-hidden power relations, the objectionable or even illegal deals between teams and sports marketing agencies, and the tax schemes used by multi-millionaires. He wanted the stories hidden in the material to be told &ndash; entire stories and not just fragments. So he handed his data over to Spiegel: eight portable hard drives containing 18.6 million documents, including original contracts complete with secret subsidiary agreements, emails, Word files, Excel charts and photos. The data reaches into 2016 and takes up a total of 1.9 terabytes of memory. That is roughly the equivalent of 500,000 Bibles. It is the largest data leak in the storyhistory of sports.</p><p>Where did the data come from? John won't say. He didn't ask Spiegel to pay him anything for the information, even though player agents recently offered him up to 650,000 Euro.</p><p>Spiegel spent weeks examining the authenticity of the documents before deciding to share the material with the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC), a consortium of 10 well-respected journalistic outlets in Europe. Sixty journalists then dove into this ocean of information, including investigative reporters, data journalists and finance experts. To enable them to share their findings, an encrypted Internet platform was built. In addition, the journalists met in Hamburg, Mechelen, Paris and Lisbon to discuss what they had found and to talk about additional sources and publication plans.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Every ticket, every shirt bought feeds a corrupt system&rdquo;</div><p>The journalists see it as their duty to show the public a side of the football industry that had thus far remained in the shadows. John, the whistleblower, sees himself as a kind of Robin Hood, as an avenger of normal football fans.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The fans have to understand that with every ticket, every shirt they buy and with every television subscription, they are feeding an extremely corrupt system that is only in it for itself,&rdquo; says John.</p><p>The origins of his platform Football Leaks extend back one-and-a-half years. during the 2015 summer transfer window, several strange, in some cases inscrutable player transfers took place in the Portuguese league.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There are leagues in Europe that are controlled by just three or four player agents. They continually make transfers with corrupt club presidents. The football system is consuming itself from the inside out,&rdquo; says John.</p><p>In response, he declared war on this football world &ndash; and has already celebrated some success. On the basis of the Football Leaks documents that have already been published, the dutch top-league team FC Twente Enschede, for example, was banned from international play due to violations. FIFA has slapped several clubs with penalties for unsavory investment deals.</p><p>Three members of European Union parliament have even cited the leaks in requesting that the European Commission launch an independent investigation into the world record transfer of Gareth Bale. In the 101 million Euro deal between Tottenham Hotspur and Real Madrid, several Spanish banks acted as guarantors &ndash; the same banks that were bailed out during the financial crisis with the help of around 40 billion Euro of taxpayer money.</p><p>But for John, these victories aren't enough. Born in Portugal, he is a clever young man who speaks five languages and is learning two more, including Russian. John is also a bon vivant who likes partying through the night with the help of prodigious quantities of lager, while keeping guests entertained with his boisterous laughter. He loves his freedom, travels frequently and seldom remains in one place for long. John is not actually his real name. With Football Leaks, he has created an unprecedented platform: An Internet database of secret, opaque and crooked deals made in the multi-billion euro business of football. And it's not just curious fans who have taken an interest in the revelations, but also police officers, public prosecutors and tax officials.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Connections to Russian mafia and African despots&rdquo;</div><p>John knows full well that exposing such information has made him plenty of enemies.</p><p>He is now sitting in Spiegel headquarters in Hamburg. His jeans are full of holes and his shoes dirty, but he doesn't care. He also doesn't care that his coffee is much too hot, finishing off his cup without setting it down even once. John is sitting in front of a computer with two screens and has another laptop on the table next to him. To search through the leaked documents, he relies on a special software program used by criminal investigators and tax agents.</p><p>Currently, he is trying to figure out who is the beneficial owner of a Maltese shell company. documents fly across the screen as John's knees bounce, his pupils jump up and down, up and down. He is no longer aware of what is going on around him &ndash; all he sees are the names, numbers and addresses in the data on the screen.</p><p>The room in which John is currently chasing down corruption in international football was set up by Spiegel specifically for the Football Leaks project. It is a so-called &ldquo;safe room,&rdquo; designed to keep out potential hackers. There are six workspaces in the office, each outfitted with a computer that is not connected to the Internet and the servers are equipped with several safeguards. Only encrypted communication is possible. For the past several months, just eight people have had access to the room.</p><p>There is good reason for the precautions. The people John is challenging are the kind who would stop at nothing for money. In the data, one can find connections to the Kazakh, Turkish and Russian mafias as well as to African despots. Yet even as they use their wealth to get in on the business of football, they aren't often seen or heard from. They do all they can to keep their names out of the media.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Football Leaks is a team effort&rdquo;</div><p>The leadership of the international sports marketing firm doyen is likewise wary of publicity. The company makes millions with transfer fees and player personality rights. Based in England and Malta, the company last year became one of Football Leaks' first targets.</p><p>John's data trove also includes documents that show how some managers seek to combat intruders. Just a few days after Football Leaks published the first contracts, doyen filed a criminal complaint with the Lisbon police. But that wasn't all. Several companies were sent after John's online platform, including IT specialists, renowned law firms and detectives &ndash; all of them hard-bitten professionals when it comes to tracking down their target.</p><p>One of the crisis managers was the head of a company belonging to a dubious Russian oligarch. One of the detectives is a graduate of the Royal Military Academy in the UK and did tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. They exerted substantial pressure on the web host of the Football Leaks homepage and the page was shut down several times as a result.</p><p>&ldquo;But we're still here!&rdquo; says John. He smiles triumphantly, his eyes open wide. John is convinced that he is doing the right thing, which doesn&rsquo;t always make it easy to work with him. John can be intractable and headstrong &ndash; and more than anything, he is extremely secretive.</p><p>Although Spiegel has been in contact with him for over a year, has met him dozens of times in different cities across Europe and has spoken with him in person or on the phone for hundreds of hours, it still isn't clear whether John is supported by patrons pursuing their own interests. John merely says that Football Leaks is a team effort. He responds to follow up questions at most with a crooked smile.</p><p>Because there is also a different, darker side to Football Leaks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Seeking a deal with the contact&rdquo;</div><p>It began on Oct. 3, 2015, just five days after the project went online for the first time. On that day, N&eacute;lio Lucas, the young, smart and morally flexible Portuguese head of sports for the football marketing company doyen, received an email.&nbsp;</p><p>It was sent by a man calling himself Artem Lobuzov, though the name could be a pseudonym. The only thing that is clear is that had been sent via Yandex, a Russian provider that is also used by Football Leaks.</p><p>In the mail, Lobuzov described the documents that he had in his possession: some of it unsavory, including photos, chat messages and emails.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;All this and much more may come online, and afterwards in all European press,&rdquo; Lobuzov wrote. &ldquo;You certainly don&rsquo;t wish that to happen, do you? But we can talk &hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>N&eacute;lio Lucas immediately suspected what he and doyen were facing. In the past few years, the manager has risen to become a big deal in the world of football, making significant deals with superstars like the Brazilian Neymar, the Spanish world champion Xavi and the Colombian striker Radamel Falcao.</p><p>Power-hungry operators like Lucas aren't used to being put under pressure. They want to be in control and keep a tight hold on their secrets and privileged knowledge. So Lucas did what he is good at and tried to strike a deal with the unknown contact.</p><p>Lobuzov seemed receptive and answered on October 5. He wrote that he could imagine a deal worth between 500,000 and one million Euro &ldquo;and you can be sure the info I have will be eliminated.&rdquo; Lobuzov proposed: &ldquo;We can solve this easily in the biggest possible secrecy, preferably between lawyers.&ldquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Lobuzov's lawyer is named An&iacute;bal Pinto and he was to continue the negotiations. Pinto is from Porto, and more of a small player &ndash; hardly a high profile lawyer. He was tasked with negotiating directly with football industry heavyweights.</p><p>The first meeting between Lucas, his lawyer and Pinto apparently took place at the end of October in Lisbon. According to an email written by a doyen manager, Lucas made a proposal during the meeting: Lobuzov would apparently receive 300,000 Euro in exchange for a cessation of the leaks.</p><p>doyen reacted angrily to a request from Spiegel for a comment about the account and the accusations. A spokesman said that &ldquo;the information is completely false and manipulated&rdquo; and that the agency would take legal action against any publication of the information. However, the spokesman didn't give any details about which documents were supposed to be manipulated</p><p>An&iacute;bal Pinto claims he did not help Lobuzov to blackmail Lucas. He says he was only engaged as an intermediary to complete a deal with another lawyer. However, when he noticed during the meeting that blackmail might be involved in the deal, he stopped the negotiations. Pinto claims that he then informed his client of the potential legal consequences of what he was doing and advised him to voluntarily cease with the blackmail attempt. Lobuzov didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Some of the people and companies mentioned in the Football Leaks documents that were contacted by Spiegel claimed in their statements that the data had been hacked. Just as doyen did, a Spanish legal practice filed a criminal complaint against the online whistleblowers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;No proof of manipulation or forgery&rdquo;</div><p>Thus far, though, none of the Football Leaks documents has been proven to be manipulated or faked. Also in the case of Twente Enschede, none of the authorities that examined the documents involved questioned their authenticity.</p><p>The story of the meeting between Lucas, his lawyer and Pinto can be reconstructed with the help of emails found in the data trove: The three men adjourned after their meeting, and two more weeks passed before Lucas would learn what Lobuzov thought of his proposal.</p><p>But who is Lobuzov? does he work together with John? Or might they be the same person? Is John a hacker? John clears his throat. He has been sitting in the Spiegel safe room for almost five hours. His cheeks are red, he keeps rubbing his eyes and he has taken off his shoes, revealing a large hole in the heel of one of his socks. It is not difficult to tell that this otherwise cool online whistleblower is not completely comfortable addressing such questions. Before answering, he stares at the screen in front of him for several minutes. &ldquo;We never hacked anyone, and like we always stated, we are not hackers. All we have is a good network of sources. All those ridiculous allegations are coming only from a criminal organization. That is what doyen is for us, a mafia organization.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>John has nothing more to say on the subject. His world is now only made up of friends and opponents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Whistleblowers: heroes - not saints&rdquo;</div><p>For journalists, cooperating with whistleblowers almost always goes hand in hand with difficult questions. does the material have sufficient relevance that the personal motives, the backgrounds and possibly even the criminal pasts of sources can be overlooked? do the documents expose problems that would otherwise remain hidden? These are not easy questions.</p><p>Famous whistleblowers in recent years have almost all been controversial personalities, with both Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning being denounced by the US as traitors. But their revelations about the US military, the intelligence agencies and their systematic spying triggered a discussion on the treatment of data and the protection of the private sphere.</p><p>Two other examples are Herv&eacute; Falciani and Bradley Birkenfeld. They contributed to the end of Swiss bank secrecy with their data leaks. The documents they made public revealed how two globally active financial institutions, UBS and HSBC, helped their clients evade billions in taxes.</p><p>But these two whistleblowers don't have spotless pasts either. Falciani, who stole the documents from the bank, allegedly first tried to sell the data to other banks. Birkenfeld himself helped a real estate agent hide around 200 million USd from the tax office. Both of them have since been convicted.</p><p>Whistleblowers become whistleblowers because they are prepared to transgress boundaries: sometimes they are the boundaries of decency and morals and sometimes they are legal boundaries. But they are always boundaries that others stay away from out of fear. That is what often makes whistleblowers into heroes, though it seldom makes them into saints.</p><p>Spiegel and its partners have decided to publish certain parts of and stories from the Football Leaks material even though we have been unable to definitively determine who exactly is behind the project.&nbsp;</p><p>The data is extremely relevant and helps shed light on a football industry that operates independently of moral and, often, legal imperatives. It has become a parallel society where money is at least as important as the ball in the game.</p><p>A further reason we are moving ahead with the publication of the material is that the attempt by Artem Lobuzov &ndash; this huge unknown with the unsavory documents &ndash; to reach a deal with the doyen representative Lucas was unsuccessful. No money exchanged hands. Lobuzov rejected the proposal.</p><p>Why that is the case isn't entirely clear. Perhaps Lobuzov got cold feet or had a falling out with his lawyer. The most likely explanation, though, is the one that can also be found in an email exchange included in the Football Leaks documents: The meeting between Pinto, N&eacute;lio Lucas and his lawyer was under surveillance. The Lisbon police listened in on and recorded it.de</p><p>Perhaps Lobuzov caught wind of it. Either way, he backed out of the deal. &ldquo;Keep your money. You are going to need it,&rdquo; he wrote &ndash; and likely meant: for lawyers.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucas reacted in a manner typical of a cinematic mafia don.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I'm not threatening you with a beating, which is what you deserve, but we are not bandits. We are people of character and principles. Your lesson will be another one that will hurt more!!!!&rdquo;</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"4eebf25c-8277-4293-9b41-2db4c46fb174\"}]"}, "pk": 1254, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Forget Messi. There are people who still consider Messi to be the best in the world. Just because Lionel Messi was football's World Player of the Year five times to Cristiano Ronaldo's three? Just because Messi has won the Champions League four times and Ronaldo three? Just because Messi scored 50 league goals in a single season to Ronaldo's 48? All of that is true, but it hardly matters beyond the game. If you're looking for the truth in football on the pitch, then you are, in fact, clueless.</p><p>The truth is that Lionel Messi got caught. This summer, he was forced to appear in a Spanish court in Barcelona, where he was slapped with a suspended jail sentence of 21 months for tax fraud. The court also ordered him to pay a fine of two million Euro because he and his father evaded taxes on 4.1 million Euro.</p><p>And Ronaldo? Or, more precisely, Mr. Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, as he is named in his Spanish tax returns? At the end of 2014, he discreetly pocketed 63.5 million Euro, but didn&rsquo;t pay a single Euro in tax on that money. And he might even get away with it. It might even have been legal. He earned 63.5 million Euro, before and after taxes, with no court case, no criminal offense and presumably not even a guilty conscience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;63.5 million Euro do not appear in tax declaration&rdquo;</div><p>So who is better at football? Ronaldo! Unless, after this article appears, a Spanish tax investigator realizes that it shouldn&rsquo;t be legally possible to set up the kind of shell company in the British Virgin Islands that has been bunkering Ronaldo&rsquo;s millions for years &ndash; through an account with a private Swiss bank. Neither the 63.5 million Euro nor the foreign accounts appear anywhere in his tax declaration.</p><p>What is it that Ronaldo said about himself? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a smart guy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you play well or badly &mdash; the most important thing is winning.&rdquo; In football, that sentence applies on the pitch, but for top players, it also applies to their bank accounts. Those who haven&rsquo;t yet found the loopholes to reduce or eliminate their need to pay taxes count among the industry&rsquo;s losers.</p><p>Indeed, Ronaldo is no exception when it comes to dodging taxes. But his name, like Messi's, is the most famous. He is the most valuable brand. He&rsquo;s the icon, the man who represents the gloss and sordidness of modern football in this story of professionals and their profits. The gloss of a global religion with 1.6 billion followers &mdash; fans consumed with their teams and enchanted by their demigods and by the seemingly supernatural tricks of a player like Ronaldo, which can often only be understood when seen in slow motion. But that sordidness is also named Ronaldo: that only the result counts, the ego, the success. That everything will somehow work out and that nothing really matters, at least as long as tax authorities keep playing along or can be deceived. And as long as the fans, who pay millions to finance these stars, don&rsquo;t find out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Biggest leak in sport history&rdquo;</div><p>But now the entire world is about to find out. The whistleblowing platform Football Leaks provided Der Spiegel with hard drives containing 1.9 terabytes of information &mdash; the biggest trove of data in the history of the sport. The stack of files is so massive and so meaningful to so many countries that Spiegel shared the material with its partners in the European Investigative Collaboration (EIC). Since then, 60 journalists from 12 different media organizations have collaborated in their analysis of the mostly confidential documents.</p><p>They reveal how Ronaldo funneled millions of Euro to a shell company in the Caribbean until 2014. He hardly paid any taxes on that money. And as if that wasn't enough, at the end of 2014, he sold his marketing rights for the years 2015 to 2020 all at once for an additional 75 million Euro. He quickly collected the money at the end of the 2014 tax year. That was the last year that he could take advantage of a minimal tax rate in Spain. He apparently paid no taxes on the 63.5 million Euro in advance, earned he took in using this method. Today, as his lawyers have confirmed, tax investigators are on his trail.</p><p>Other professional footballers also set up repositories for their money in exotic countries. They include Pepe and Ricardo Carvalho, both of whom played on the Portuguese national team that won the European Championship this summer.&nbsp;</p><p>James Rodr&iacute;guez, top goal scorer at the World Cup in Brazil, is also on the list. All three play or played for Real Madrid, the world&rsquo;s richest club, where it's not just the player salaries that are extremely high, but also their chutzpah when it comes to paying taxes. The list of Real players who tried to be more clever than Spanish tax law apparently allows also includes a member of the world-champion German national team: Mesut &Ouml;zil, who today plays for Arsenal. He may not have funneled his money to a tax haven, but a few months ago he received a tax bill from his earlier previous stop in Spain. &Ouml;zil is supposed to pay two million Euro in back taxes in addition to an almost 790,000 Euro penalty, as documents from Football Leaks show.</p><p>This is not the end of the list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;The one billion Euro player&rdquo;</div><p>Professional football today is the greatest show on earth. The measure of the biggest stars in this show is money, either in Euro or dollars. The transfer sums are growing, as are salaries and advertising revenues. Ronaldo earns 38 million Euro a year at Real and his transfer fee &ndash; the amount another team would have to pay to wrest him away from Real &ndash; is one billion Euro. Player salaries have become so astronomical that megalomania has become inherent to the sport. Why share those millions or pay taxes on them?</p><p>Football Leaks is now exposing the uglier side of these success stories: These stars apparently want to give back as little to society as possible &mdash; none at all if they can get away with it. To do so, they and their teams of advisors navigate the often murky waters of tax law. Those who don&rsquo;t play this game &mdash; because they still feel a sense of responsibility to society &ndash; are likely seen as being too weak for success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;He will anyway earn a lot of money&rdquo;</div><p>One sentence in the mountain of data stands out. It was written by Hans Erik Odegaard of Norway in december 2015, after Real Madrid signed his 16-year-old son to the team, hailing him as one of Europe&rsquo;s most talented players. Spanish lawyers had calculated the effect such a tax-saving company might have on the player's marketing revenues &ndash; the kind of company that has become so common among football professionals.</p><p>But Odegaard's father had some concerns and wrote: &ldquo;He will anyway earn a lot of money, so it&rsquo;s also a moral question about how much effort he shall do, trying to save some tax money when other people are struggling much harder to pay their bills.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The Football Leaks data contains several million documents, and it takes a lot of searching before you run across an email like that.</p><p>Martin Odegaard also isn&rsquo;t so easy to find these days. He currently plays mostly on Real&rsquo;s reserve team and has only played for the main team twice. He is reportedly unhappy in Madrid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Two million dollars for six hours of work&rdquo;</div><p>So what&rsquo;s a day in the life of Cristiano Ronaldo worth? That&rsquo;s difficult to say, but there are some clues: He can earn 1.9 million USD for six hours and 45 minutes worth of work. That&rsquo;s $4,691 a minute, as revealed in an advertising contract Ronaldo&rsquo;s marketing agents signed with Toyota in June 2013. Toyota covered Ronaldo's first-class airfare to the filming site where he stood in front of the cameras for three-and-a-half hours before lunch and three hours and 15 minutes afterwards &ndash; everything was precisely detailed. The carmaker was then able to use the images in its advertisements for 13 months.</p><p>For $1.9 million, however, you won&rsquo;t get the world from Ronaldo. Toyota had merely secured the rights for ads in the Middle East, plus Algeria, Morocco and Afghanistan. The company would have had to pay more for global rights. Or a different one: Because Honda featured Ronaldo in its advertisements in China at the same time. According to the contract, it brought in an additional two million Euro for a one-year contract and a maximum of six hours of work in front of the camera. Additional camera time in China, in the event it became necessary, would cost 600,000 Euro more &mdash; a bargain by Ronaldo&rsquo;s standards.</p><p>Football is global, which makes Ronaldo not only a sports star around the world, but also an advertising star. He earns far more than simply his premium salary at Real Madrid. In recent years, he has been the face of shampoo brand Clear, watchmaker TAG Heuer, fashion label Armani and sporting giant Nike. The US trainer giant continually releases new models bearing the legendary CR7 logo, the seven standing for Ronaldo&rsquo;s Real Madrid shirt number.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;13 per cent of all underpants revenue to Ronaldo&rdquo;</div><p>The money pours in, if one believes the contracts: According to the documents, US food mega-corp Herbalife paid more than 16 million USD over a five-year period. Ronaldo received 2.25 million Euro from Portugal&rsquo;s Banco Espirito Santo for three years and 300,000 Euro for a television appearance in Rome. And he received 1.1 million Euro from the airline Emirates, along with 15 first-class tickets to Dubai from anywhere in the world.</p><p>For every pair of briefs bearing the CR7 logo on the waistline, Danish underwear company JBS must pay 13 per cent of its revenues to the player. At Nike, it&rsquo;s five per cent of sales on CR7 shoes. The American company brought in 51 million Euro in global revenues with CR7-branded apparel between September 2010 and August 2011, with just under 2.6 million Euro of that money going to the company that collects Ronaldo&rsquo;s fees. In addition to that, Nike also pays Ronaldo a base salary of 1.6 million Euro a year, plus the industry-standard premium payments for particularly successful seasons. When, for example, he became the top scorer in the Spanish league, he received an additional 250,000 Euro.</p><p>And advertising customers continue to pay and pay. This creates the same conundrum for Ronaldo that faces all of the world's superrich: What to do with all this money? To be sure, for every Euro he earns with his image rights above 15 million per year, he is required to pay 40 cents to his employer Real Madrid. That, at least, is what his contract requires.</p><p>But he only has to step out of his door for a few hours and say something to the camera &ndash; and the next couple hundred thousand or million Euro end up in his account. It&rsquo;s as easy as that. But there are complications. The Government, after all, also wants a cut of the money.</p><p>But there are advisors &ndash; image rights specialists &ndash; to take care of that, and not just for Ronaldo. The lawyers take care of everything earned by professional football players with their name, their face, their image and their autograph. Most of that revenue comes from advertising, but there are other sources too, like the stickers of players that kids collect in their Panini albums.</p><p>It&rsquo;s difficult to dodge taxes on salaries paid by the club. The rules in place are quite clear, the money-paths obvious and the tax authorities tough. Image rights, though, are a different matter, and tax lawyers have become true artists when it comes to erecting the elaborate, labyrinthine structures into which the money flows.</p><p>Tax authorities are always trying to play catch-up and are often either overwhelmed by the complexity or thwarted by laws in some countries that have been made overly friendly to football. Often enough, the hunt ends before it has truly begun. If things go well for the player, the tax authorities are satisfied with a small payment. And if things go really well, the players pay nothing at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Copyright: El Mundo/ Alberto di Lolli\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/SPAIN%20(14).jpg\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><style type=\\\"text/css\\\">p.p1{margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:11.0px Helvetica}p.p2{margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:11.0px Helvetica;min-height:13.0px}span.s1{letter-spacing:0.0px}</style></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Image rights not taxed as high as salaries&rdquo;</div><p>The model works more or less like this: Professional salaries fall into the highest tax bracket, which is more than 50 per cent in many European countries. It can be painful. Revenues generated via image rights, by contrast, aren't taxed at nearly as high a rate, if one sets up the necessary structures. To do so, players transfer their image rights to a company working on their behalf. Fees generated by those rights &ndash; standing in front of the cameras for a muesli bar or deodorant brand, for example &ndash; are then paid to that company, which only owes corporate taxes on those earnings, just like any normal company. In Ireland, a popular location for such image-rights firms, the corporate tax rate is only 12.5 per cent.</p><p>The companies that use these stars to peddle their products aren&rsquo;t the only ones paying the image firms. They also receive money from the football clubs themselves. Real Madrid, for example, buys a portion of its players' image rights: In Ronaldo&rsquo;s case, it is 40 per cent. In exchange, Real pays the professional players a set fee that is also taxed at the lower corporate rate.</p><p>Basically, this is how it is done in all the major European leagues. A British court even confirmed in 2000 that the practice was above board - in the case of Dutch player Dennis Bergkamp. But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it is also legal in other cases. Tax authorities aren't fond of this clever division of payments because it denies the state millions in revenues. As such, professional players are often placed under investigation for possible tax evasion. There&rsquo;s a fine line to be drawn, and it&rsquo;s not always clear where it is to be found. Authorities probe things like whether the image rights that a club purchases from its star players are actually worth the high price paid. Is the club actually able to come close to recouping that investment through, for example, the sale of shirts or autographed memorabilia? If not, the goal is apparently that of paying a significant portion of a player's salary at the lower corporate rate. And that would be against the law.</p><p>When it comes to superstars, who earn millions for their teams through shirt sales alone, the tax authorities often take a closer look at the image firm: does it have offices and employees or is it purely a shell company? Depending on the national laws in place, that might be considered to be money earned domestically and, as such, subject to full taxation.</p><p>The greater the profit generated, the greater the risk that something can go wrong. The advantages of using image rights to make money are immense, but they come hand in hand with the risk of falling afoul of the tax authorities. One could simply avoid the practice as young Norwegian player Martin Odegaard apparently did. But if you have an agent like Jorge Mendes, you don't avoid it. You take the plunge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">With Jorge Mendes &ldquo;players become gamblers&rdquo;</div><p>Mendes is currently the world&rsquo;s most successful football agent. He represents the most famous players and makes the biggest deals. He also appears to be the most audacious when it comes to tax constructs. Mendes is capable of making players dizzyingly rich. But with him, players also become gamblers &mdash; with the help of Caribbean shell companies that are kept concealed. For good reason, one can assume.</p><p>Mendes represents Spanish national team goalkeeper David de Gea and the 2014 World Cup Golden Boot winner Rodr&iacute;guez, of Colombia, and Manchester United coach Jos&eacute; Mourinho. He represents half the European champion Portuguese national team including Pepe, Andr&eacute; Gomes and Ricardo Carvalho in addition to the young Renato Sanchez, who now plays for Bayern Munich. Most importantly, he represents Cristiano Ronaldo.</p><p>A documentary hit cinemas last year about Ronaldo&rsquo;s life (200,000 USD was paid for his participation, plus a cut of revenues). The film delves into the death of Ronaldo&rsquo;s father at an early age and Ronaldo talks about how Mendes is &ldquo;like a father&rdquo; to him: &ldquo;Jorge Mendes is a part of my family.&rdquo; Naturally &ldquo;Big Jorge&rdquo; is also the &ldquo;best agent in the world,&rdquo; a title that Mendes has, in fact, been honored with six successive times at the international Globe Soccer Awards.</p><p>Like Ronaldo, Mendes knows what it&rsquo;s like to be poor, but also how good it can feel to have so much money that it no longer fits into the safe at home, as the football superstar says in the documentary. Both came from families that could give them little beyond the boundless ambition necessary to work their way to money, success and fame.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Mendes &ldquo;a top salesman&rdquo;</div><p>Mendes achieved his success as a talented salesman. First he flogged videos and then opened a bar before arranging the transfer of one of his regulars, goalkeeper Nuno Esp&iacute;rito Santo, to Deportivo La Coruna. Soon, he began dealing in ever-bigger names, in part because he is good at getting others to think as highly of him as he does of himself.</p><p>In one scene, he is at dinner with friends and family of Ronaldo, standing in front of the football star. Mendes begins singing his praises: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a monster. That&rsquo;s the best in the world, the best football player in the world &hellip; I am proud to stand next to such a man &hellip; if I didn't know you, I'd ask for an autograph.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand why footballers adore him, especially given that Mendes is better than others at getting his clients on the big-name teams and landing enormous contracts. By his own account, from 2001 to 2010, he was involved in more than half of all transfers made by top Portuguese clubs Benfica, Sporting and FC Porto. From there, he brokered players to the really big football money in England, Spain and Italy. &ldquo;Nothing is impossible,&rdquo; Mendes preaches in the Ronaldo film, &ldquo;nothing, nothing, nothing.&rdquo; He can&rsquo;t even stop saying &ldquo;nothing,&rdquo; adding &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; again and again. But if nothing is impossible, then what&rsquo;s possible when it comes to player taxes? That, namely, has apparently long been part of the package Mendes offers his clients: a tax model that helps top earners avoid taxes to the extent possible. Legally? Illegally? Nothing seems impossible. Nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Helping &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; Hide His Money</div><p>Jos&eacute; Mourinho is a star coach rather than a star player, but when it comes to what he earns and the airs he puts on, there isn&rsquo;t much of a difference. Mourinho, who today plies his trade at Manchester United, was one of the first professionals for whom Mendes established a tax-saving structure in the Caribbean. He set it up based on the same two principles that guided Mourinho in football: Losing is absolutely unacceptable and any trick that results in victory is allowed.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a legendary tale about how Mourinho once got banned from attending a game against Bayern Munich and nonetheless still managed to give instructions to the coaches on the bench. The Times of London would later report that he hid in a laundry basket in order to avoid detection as he was smuggled out of the stadium following the match.</p><p>The Football Leaks documents now shed light on what the Portuguese manager's legal tricks have brought him. Spanish tax authorities recently tapped him for 4.4 million Euro: more than three million Euro in back taxes and a 1.1 million euro penalty on top.</p><p>What happened? In 2004, Mourinho switched from Porto to FC Chelsea in London. He had won everything in Porto &mdash; the Portuguese league championship and, surprisingly, even the Champions League. This set the stage for him to get the kind of major money that can&rsquo;t be earned in Portugal. FC Chelsea London is a club where winning European football&rsquo;s crown is not a surprise. It is expected. Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich had bought the club and he began shopping around for players with no concern for money. There were no limits.</p><p>Mourinho, too, earned a hefty salary &ndash; it is said to be around 5.3 million GBP a year. That was his regular pay, on which he had to pay full taxes consistent with his top earner status. But he also received an addition 1.5 million GBP for his image rights from Chelsea from 2004 to 2009. To be more precise, he didn&rsquo;t get the money directly &mdash; instead, it went to the Caribbean, to Koper Services SA, a shell company located in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). The letterbox firm resides at Vanterpool Plaza in Road Town on the island of Tortola, which sounds far more glamorous than it actually is. The plaza is really just a yellow stuccoed, two-story building. On the ground floor is a pharmacy run by a Ms. Vanterpool, while the floor above is rented by a law firm that sets up shell companies. They are located behind the drawn curtains. If any work is actually being done here, it is surely not being done by Koper Services.</p><p>It is just a large piggy bank. Up until at least 2013, millions of Euro from Mourinho's marketing earnings flowed into the BVI-based company. To facilitate this, the coach had transferred his image rights to Koper back in 2004, when he transferred to Chelsea. The company has been in charge of his marketing ever since, and has raked in the revenues. And these revenues are conveniently taxed at the BVI corporate tax rate of, you got it, zero per cent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;The uncomfortable suspicion of tax evasion&rdquo;</div><p>But there was still a problem: Renowned brands like Adidas aren't fond of having to transfer fees to tax havens. Should the company be audited, such payments could raise the uncomfortable suspicion that the company was abetting tax evasion or financing some other dubious deals. Advertising partners expect a better address than Road Town on the island of Tortola, and in this case, that address was to be found in Ireland. Even before Koper was founded, an Irish tax accountant had established a different company in Dublin called Multi-Sports Image Management (MIM).</p><p>Ireland was the kind of European Union country &ndash; the kind of buffer &ndash; that the deal needed so that companies like Adidas and professional football clubs like Chelsea were prepared to pay for image rights. But neither the company's location nor the tax accountant were chosen at random. With its low corporate tax rate, Ireland is seen as something of a tax haven within the EU. And the same accounting office in Dublin that founded MIM also worked for &ldquo;Big Jorge&rdquo; Mendes, offering its services to Gestifute, the agent's primary company.</p><p>Those interested in using Mourinho for marketing purposes had to pay a fee to MIM in Ireland &ndash; and who cares what happens to the money after that? The Football Leaks documents show that MIM received a small commission: Initially it was 6.5 per cent before dropping to four per cent in 2010. A second Ireland-based company, called Polaris, got involved later &ndash; the only organization that had real personnel and did real work. The company was responsible for generating marketing deals for Mourinho, receiving 20 per cent of any earnings.</p><p>MIM and Polaris had to pay the Irish corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent on any profits they generated, but the money they received in commissions was a tiny portion of the overall sum. The rest was sent to Koper on the British Virgin Islands where no taxes at all were due.</p><p>So far, so rich. How, though, would Mourinho one day be able to extract his money from the tax haven piggy bank? It wasn't an easy problem to solve, particularly given that nobody was supposed to learn that the shell company was even connected to Mourinho. The documents make it clear that his tax advisors were apparently concerned that the entire structure could be revealed as a vast tax evasion scheme if it became known that Mourinho's money ended up with Koper.</p><p>The beneficiaries of Koper were thus kept well hidden. Straw men stood behind the Caribbean company. And who was hiding behind them? A foundation in far-away New Zealand. The documents indicate that it was founded by Mourinho in 2008. But he isn't the beneficiary of the foundation.</p><p>It would be difficult for the scavenger hunt to lead further away from Mourinho than New Zealand. Compared to a standard game of hide-and-seek, it was quite a masterful effort at invisibility. But who in New Zealand? The foundation is called Kaitaia Trust and Mourinho's name is not listed in the commercial register. Indeed, the only name that appears is that of an Auckland-based firm that specializes in the founding of companies. The hunt, in other words, isn't over.</p><p>It is the trust's certificate of incorporation, which is also part of the Football Leaks documents, that provides the most important clue: The foundation's beneficiaries according to the certificate are &ldquo;Mourinho's current wife and his children.&rdquo; A further document in the data hints at who the stash held by Koper belongs to. Koper account statements from 31 December 2013 indicates that the firm owes Jose Mourinho 11,979,657 Euro, the document notes. Owes? That was apparently the trick: Mourinho trusted his marketing revenues &ndash; more than 11 million Euro &ndash; to Koper. Officially, the money didn't belong to him, but it stayed in his family, within his reach &ndash; essentially untouched in Koper accounts in Switzerland.</p><p>Things only became particularly uncomfortable for Mourinho after he transferred to Real Madrid in 2010 and then back for another stint at Chelsea in mid-2013. In July 2014, Spanish authorities began digging into the years Mourinho spent in Madrid and into his network of companies. The club had consistently withheld 10 per cent of each payment to Koper and forwarded it on to the tax office in accordance with the law. But most of the football manager's other marketing partners sent their payments to Ireland without withholding anything at all. From there, Mourinho's money &ndash; minus the standard commissions owed to MIM and Polaris &ndash; was sent to the zero-tax paradise of the British Virgin Islands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Never submitted a tax declaration for image rights&rdquo;</div><p>The football manager never submitted a Spanish tax declaration for his image rights revenues. As early as June 2013, Julio Senn, partner at the tax accounting firm Senn Ferrero, began realizing that things wouldn't end well. Senn, who was once director general of Real Madrid and is today the most sought after attorney for football players with tax problems in Spain, spoke with a coworker who had been involved in Lionel Messi's tax case. The Barcelona star had based his image-rights company in Uruguay. Senn then wrote to a tax expert named Carlos Osorio, who advised Mendes, saying that it looked as though Spanish tax officials had settled upon a strategy. Only in cases where the image-rights companies belonging to football players had real personnel and real offices were they left alone. Otherwise, Senn wrote, revenues were being seen as part of a player's normal salary. And had to be taxed as such. For Mendes' clients, it was terrible news.</p><p>Senn was initially concerned about Mourinho. He hadn't yet registered his foreign holdings even though it had been required in Spain since 2012. In September 2014, the attorney was hoping that Mourinho would at least manage to avoid criminal proceedings. Mourinho was prepared to pay &ldquo;whatever it takes&rdquo; to avoid such a fiasco, an approach that a lawyer colleague endorsed. He believed that Mourinho wouldn't be the only loser, &ldquo;we all would.&rdquo; Mendes, he noted, was extremely nervous.</p><p>That was understandable considering he had set up a similar tax model for most of his clients, one in which an offshore company received revenues from image rights. If one adds up the revenues of his most important clients that ended up in the Caribbean, the total is at least 180 million Euro. Internally, Senn &ndash; who was, as of 2014, charged with extricating Mendes's players and Mourinho from the difficulties they were in &ndash; didn't hide how he felt about the Mendes model. In an email to Mendes' tax expert Osorio de Castro, who had served as an advisor for the model, he wrote: &ldquo;don't forget that the structure that all of Jorge's clients have isn't the most appropriate for people who live in Spain.&rdquo; Senn added that Osorio de Castro had been told many times that the tax construction was unsuited for image rights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">The structure &ldquo;is a serious problem for the player&rdquo;</div><p>Senn was most explicit when it came to the acute difficulties facing Portuguese national team player F&aacute;bio Coentrao. As a client of Mendes, he also had a shell company in the Caribbean. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; Senn wrote, &ldquo;the structure you have set up is a serious problem for the player.&rdquo;</p><p>It was also a problem for Mendes himself. &ldquo;Let's hope that they (editor&rsquo;s note: tax officials) don't view Jorge's company structure in Ireland as a necessary aid for the players to avoid paying taxes in Spain,&rdquo; Senn wrote. Regarding Coentrao, he wrote: &ldquo;It could be that circumstances that are less problematic than those we are defending against the tax authorities are seen as tax violations.&rdquo;</p><p>Senn was all the more relieved &ndash; and likely surprised &ndash; when he was able to report on 3 June 2015 following negotiations with the tax officials that it looked like Mourinho would get off relatively easy. He would be spared criminal proceedings and a public trial. He would only have to pay. Koper would even be allowed to write off a few costs &ndash; and there was even a reduction for the year 2013 because Mourinho had moved from Spain to England that summer. The result was a reduction of the sum tax officials were demanding. It was, Senn concluded, still a lot of money, but in light of the extremely worrisome situation at the beginning, it was satisfactory.</p><p>Confirmation from Spanish tax officials arrived on 30 June 2015. They accused Mourinho of negligence and of concealing his image-rights revenues and made clear that he should have declared the millions he made from marketing each year and paid taxes on the sum. The tax authority determined that all of the money parked with Koper belonged to him. The state demanded a total of 5.8 million Euro: 3.3 million Euro in back taxes for his image rights and a 1.1 million Euro penalty.</p><p>Mourinho has since paid that sum. On top of that was an additional 880,000 Euro in back taxes and a 550,000 Euro penalty for another tax matter. But Senn has filed an appeal against this portion of the ruling. Now that there were no criminal charges or an embarrassing trial to fear, he sought to avoid the penalty for that issue by way of a formality: Tax officials, he argued, took too long for their investigation. Legally, such investigations can take a maximum of 365 days, but Senn claimed that it had continued for 373 days. Spanish officials have countered that the delay came as a result of foot-dragging from Mourinho's team. Mourinho had managed to avoid a large war with the authorities, but he is happy to engage in a smaller skirmish. When it comes to ambition and the desire to avoid losing at all costs, &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; &ndash; as his attorneys referred to him in internal mails &ndash; can hardly be beat.</p><p>Except by one.</p><p>The moneyed Footballer of the Year</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;The Caribbean safehouses&rdquo;</div><p>There are many piggy banks in the Caribbean. The one belonging to F&aacute;bio Coentrao, based in Panama, is called Rodinn. Ricardo Carvalho's is called Alda Ventures and is in the British Virgin Islands. Pepe's Weltex Capital is likewise in BVI as is Kenalton Asset, belonging to James Rodr&iacute;guez. All of them are millionaires, all of them play or played for Real and all are Mendes clients. But none of these piggy banks were ever as crammed full of money as the one called Tollin Associates. Tollin, according to the documents, belonged to Cristiano Ronaldo. This was based in Vanterpool Plaza in Road Town on the British Virgin Islands, above a pharmacy belonging to Ms. Vanterpool, before it was suddenly dissolved in early 2015.</p><p>Mendes' advisors were afraid of nothing more than the idea that Spanish tax investigators, on the search for Ronaldo's millions, could happen across this company and begin asking too many questions. Ronaldo was the brand that had to remain spotless, a name on which Mendes had staked his own success.</p><p>Ronaldo signed with Real Madrid in 2009 after his new club had paid a record transfer fee of 94 million Euro to Manchester United. Soon thereafter, on a hot day in July 2009, 80,000 fans filled Bernab&eacute;u Stadium not to watch a football match, but to bow down to their new football god. Ronaldo, who was 24 at the time and already approaching the peak of his talents, pulled on the white shirt of his new club. He juggled a ball, kissed a child and then the emblem on his breast. It was a grand production.</p><p>But half a year previously &ndash; according to the documents, which may have been back-dated &ndash; Ronaldo had already placed his name beneath a different contract. Without fans and without a spectacle. It was a contract that made the reigning football player of the year into the football earner of the year.</p><p>The six-page document guaranteed Ronaldo earnings that were initially almost as high as his Real salary &ndash; just that the majority of this money would apparently remain hidden. The contracting party was Tollin Associates Ltd.</p><p>As was standard for Mendes clients, the football idol ceded all of his image rights to the shell company. In return, Ronaldo would be entitled to all of the earnings that Tollin would make over the course of the next six years, minus minor withholdings that are hardly worth mentioning.</p><p>The Ireland-based companies MIM and Polaris were also involved. They were responsible for negotiating global sponsorship and marketing deals on behalf of Ronaldo and they took in all the money. Tollin was hidden in the background and marketing partners didn't have to do business directly with the offshore shell company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;More than 70 million Euro flowed to British Virgin Islands&rdquo;</div><p>A small amount of the money that landed in Ireland went to Ronaldo's employer Real Madrid in accordance with their contract because they, too, were able to profit from the Cristiano Ronaldo brand, so long as his marketing earnings exceeded a certain amount. MIM and Polaris also took what was owed them in the form of commissions, sometimes up to 30 per cent and thus much higher than in the case of Mourinho. But the millions of Euro that remained all went to Tollin, including the multi-million lump sum that Real had paid so that it could receive a share of Ronaldo's marketing earnings.</p><p>In total, more than 70 million Euro flowed to Tollin between 2009 and 2014 and for years, Spanish tax authorities knew nothing about Ronaldo's secret stash. It was only in his 2014 tax return &ndash; the year in which the Tollin contract expired &ndash; that some of the money made an appearance. But it was just 11.5 million Euro.</p><p>Did Ronaldo funnel the almost 60 million Euro that remained past the tax authorities?</p><p>Ronaldo, a favorite of the football gods, would appear to be the chosen one when it comes to earthly things like taxes as well. He was able to profit from the &ldquo;Lex Beckham,&rdquo; a law passed by the Spanish government in 2004 to attract top scientists and business leaders to the country with the help of a low tax rate. De facto, however, the rule quickly turned into an advantage for Spanish top clubs in the competition for the world's best football players.</p><p>The law bestowed foreign players like David Beckham of Britain and Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal the status of &ldquo;impatriado.&rdquo; The loophole was only open to those who hadn't lived in Spain during the previous ten years and meant that those holding &ldquo;impatriado&rdquo; status only had to pay a tax rate of just under 25 per cent on their earnings. Ronaldo's Spanish teammates, by contrast, had to pay more than 50 per cent. The greatest gift, though, was the fact that Ronaldo only had to pay tax on money that he earned in Spain. Earnings from abroad, including marketing revenues, were of no concern to Spanish tax authorities.</p><p>The law was revoked in 2010. Argentinian star Lionel Messi was unable to benefit because he also has Spanish citizenship. But foreign players who moved to Spain by the end of 2009 were granted a transition period that expired on Jan. 1, 2015. And it was this regulation that Ronaldo and his advisors took full advantage of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Majority of marketing earnings were outside of Spain&rdquo;</div><p>Thanks to &ldquo;Lex Beckham,&rdquo; Ronaldo was only liable for taxes on 20 per cent of the millions he had parked with Tollin Associates. That was the share of his marketing revenues that his lawyers estimated came from Spain &ndash; the share on which he only had to pay a 24.75 per cent tax rate. The majority of his marketing earnings, that which had been earned outside of Spain, wasn't taxed at all.</p><p>The year 2015, though, marked the end of the privilege &ndash; for Ronaldo as well. After that, like every top earner in Spain, he would be responsible for turning over roughly half of his earnings to the state &ndash; and that included sums earned outside of Spain. But Cristiano Ronaldo apparently wasn't prepared to leave that much money to the Spanish authorities. His advisors dug deep into the chest full of tax tricks &ndash; to the murky, mucky bottom.</p><p>In late December 2014, just before the transition period was set to expire, the football professional sold his image rights for the years 2015 to 2020 for almost 75 million Euro &ndash; to go with the some 75 million that had already flowed into Tollin at the lower tax rate. The buyers of the rights were two newly established shell companies on the British Virgin Islands, one called Arnel and the other Adifore, and they were again registered at Vanterpool Plaza in Road Town on the island of Tortola.</p><p>The contracts were notarized on 20 December, 2014 in Morocco. Time was of the essence: The contracts had to be finalized by the end of the year and Ronaldo at the time was playing in the FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco.</p><p>The contract with Arnel was for Ronaldo's image rights for Spain while Adifore holds his image rights for the rest of the world. On December 20 Ronaldo submitted an invoice to each of the two companies. From Arnel, he demanded 11.2 million Euro for the Spanish rights while he billed Adifore 63.5 million for the global rights. Both payments were to be made to account number 413416 at the small, exclusive private bank Mirabaud &amp; Cie in Geneva. The money arrived just four days later.</p><p>According to two additional contracts signed just a couple of days later, the purchase price was then to be reduced by around 15 million Euro &ndash; three million less for the Spanish share and 12 million lower for the global rights. Why? It's not clear. Did Ronaldo in fact pay this money back? There is no proof of his having done so in the account documents that are part of the data trove. Ronaldo's 2014 tax return likewise only lists 11.25 million in marketing revenues from Spain.</p><p>What, though, was the reason for the hectic activity in Morocco? Ronaldo apparently wanted to take advantage of the lower, 24.75 per cent tax rate on his Spanish image rights for the years 2015 to 2020 before the impatriado rule expired. At the same time, 2014 was also the last year that he didn't have to pay taxes on his foreign marketing earnings &ndash; the global rights that had just earned him 63.5 million Euro all at once. Taken together, the tax advantage of doing so was around 35 million Euro. That's how much he would have had to pay the Spanish tax authorities had he declared it in subsequent years.</p><p>But there was also likely a second factor. Tax investigators at the time were closing in on other Mendes clients. Even as Ronaldo was able to profit from the tax benefits, his lawyers were no longer comfortable with the structures they had set up on the British Virgin Islands. They wanted the company Tollin to disappear at the end of 2014.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Nothing about Tollin&rdquo;</div><p>To sell his rights, Ronaldo needed a powerful buyer, someone who could hand over 75 million in one lump sum to pay for the marketing revenues that the player would rake in over the next six years. That person is named Peter Lim. The businessman from Singapore is worth an estimated 2.4 billion USD and has close ties with agent Mendes. And, even more important for this kind of deal, Ronaldo himself calls Lim &ldquo;a good friend.&rdquo; It looks as though he was behind the two British Virgin Islands companies Adifore and Arnel.</p><p>It was almost a perfect tax-saving model for Ronaldo &ndash; almost. In late June 2015, he filed his tax return for 2014. Julio Senn's team &ndash; Spain's top accountants in this game versus the tax authorities &ndash; had compiled it and they listed his earnings right down to the cent. Salary from his employer: 34,672,988.31 Euro, in accordance with his old contract. Assets: his house in Madrid (4.5 million Euro), some money in his bank accounts for the odd purchase here and there (10,799,387 Euro) and cars, including exclusive sports cars like his McLaren MP4, his Lamborghini Aventador and his Ferrari 599 (1,248,152 Euro).</p><p>Not listed in his 2014 tax return, however, and apparently of no interest to the Spanish tax authorities, were his foreign assets. His 15 homes in Portugal, his accounts at St. Galler Kantonalbank in Switzerland, Banco BPI in Portugal and Banque Internationale in Luxembourg. There was likewise no word about his account in the private bank Mirabaud in Geneva, where the 75 million from the sale of his image rights to Arnel and Adifore ended up. By the end of 2014, his deposits there amounted to more than 110 million Euro.</p><p>Ronaldo had received 63.5 million Euro of that sum from Adifore for his global image rights, apparently without paying a single Euro in taxes. Because he didn't have to? Because the law left open this gaping loophole? Or was it more of a matter of interpretation?</p><p>Whatever the case, Ronaldo's tax accountants had a difficult time deciding what they should reveal to the authorities about his marketing revenues. The day before the deadline for filing the return, the document only reflected the 11.2 million Euro that Ronaldo had received from Arnel for his Spanish image rights for the years 2015 to 2020. He was prepared to pay taxes on that sum.</p><p>But what about the Spanish marketing revenues for the years 2009 to 2014 that had ended up with Tollin? The draft said nothing about that money, although Ronaldo was required to pay taxes on it. Tollin had received 11.5 million Euro from ads involving Ronaldo in Spain. The money was ultimately included in the final draft, dated June 30, and added to the 11.2 million from the Arnel deal for a total of 22.7 million. There was no indication that the money came from a shell company based in the British Virgin Islands &ndash; in none of the declarations that he was required to submit.</p><p>The Senn Ferrero team feared the worst. They wrote to Osorio, the tax expert who worked with Mendes, that they wanted nothing to do with Ronaldo's tax model. &ldquo;We didn't participate in the structure's design, implementation or monitoring,&rdquo; they expressly stated. In other words, Mendes and his team were responsible. Once everything had been sent off, a Senn employee wrote to his colleagues: &ldquo;Thank God we've covered our backs a million times because I can already see that this tax return will have consequences.&rdquo;</p><p>And it did. An audit began at the end of 2015, initially for the years from 2011 to 2013. A tumultuous period followed for Senn Ferrero. They suddenly had to produce multiple documents as quickly as possible, including Ronaldo's contracts with Real Madrid, with his sponsors and with the Ireland-based marketing companies MIM and Polaris. The team assigned with protecting Ronaldo, led by Julio Senn, knew exactly where the weakest point in Ronaldo's tax model could be found. Tollin.</p><p>Osorio, the long-time tax expert for Mendes who had provided his expertise for the offshore model, realized it as well. The Senn team wanted to know from him who Tollin actually belonged to. The response: &ldquo;The information about Tollin, the most sensitive, we have to talk about it.&rdquo; A couple of days later, the Mendes accountant wrote: &ldquo;Say nothing about the beneficiaries of Tollin or about the trustee without speaking to me first.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;We did it&hellip; Thank God!&rdquo;</div><p>Why was everybody so concerned when it came to Tollin?</p><p>Ronaldo was apparently lucky this time around &ndash; or enjoyed a significant amount of understanding from the Spanish tax authorities. There are, after all, agents there who are so close to people from Senn Ferrero that they don't just send emails to the lawyers from their official email accounts, but also from their private accounts. In the end, they declined to consider Ronaldo as the owner of Tollin, even though so much of his money flowed to the firm. The news put Senn Ferrero in a self-congratulatory mood: &ldquo;We did it.&rdquo; The officials don't view the companies &ldquo;that do business with MIM, Tollin in this case,&rdquo; as being owned by the players. &ldquo;Thank God.&rdquo;</p><p>Ultimately, the relief could prove to be premature. Thus far, the authorities have only examined Ronaldo's tax returns up until 2013. Should they decide to take a closer look at 2014, as Ronaldo's lawyers expect they will, the role played by Tollin as well as the sale of Ronaldo's image rights to the British Virgin Islands-based companies Arnel and Adifore will become apparent.</p><p>Would the authorities once again decide that nothing was askance? Would Ronaldo again get lucky? The decisive question is: Was it legal for Ronaldo to claim his image rights earnings for 2015 to 2020 in 2014, the last year he could enjoy the privileges bestowed upon him as a result of the expiring &ldquo;Lex Beckham&rdquo; law? And prior to that, shouldn't all of the marketing revenues generated in Spain for Tollin have been assigned to him? He was, after all, the sole beneficiary of the shell company.</p><p>All of the money collected by Tollin belongs to him according to the contract. For tax experts such as the German-Spanish lawyer Rafael Villena from Hamburg, who has spent years examining such structures, the situation is clear:&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ronaldo should have declared all of the money paid to Tollin for each year from 2009 onwards, and not only in 2014.&rdquo; And regarding the income from the years 2015 to 2020: &ldquo;He should not have been allowed to declare it in 2014. I can't imagine any tax authority recognizing such a thing.&rdquo;</p><p>The Munich-based lawyer Peter Duvinage, who has provided contractual consulting to show-business stars and athletes for years, agrees.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When it comes to tax structures involving an offshore paradise like the British Virgin Islands, the alarm bells have to go off for all tax officials.&rdquo;</p><p>That could have been what Julio Senn had in mind when he wrote Mendes' tax accountant Osorio de Castro on March 16, 2016: &ldquo;The only good thing is that Tollin no longer existed in 2015.&rdquo;</p><p>The EIC network presented the results of its reporting to stars, clubs and agencies that play a role in this story. The extensive list of questions was primarily aimed at finding out what they knew of the activities engaged in, what they had to say about the accusations leveled against them and how they assess the documents. Cristiano Ronaldo and agent Jorge Mendes declined to answer. Portuguese players Carvalho, Coentrao and Pepe as well as the Colombian Real Madrid star Rodriguez and Jose Mourinho also didn't respond. Neither did we receive a reply from billionaire Peter Lim and the Ireland-based companies MIM and Polaris.</p><p>We did, however, receive a statement from Carlos Osorio de Castro, Mendes' tax expert.</p><p>&ldquo;I have nothing to do with the construction of a company structure for image rights for the players named,&rdquo; he wrote. He likewise &ldquo;categorically denied&rdquo; all accusations and said he refuses to say anything about professional issues or clients as a matter of principle. Osorio de Castro inveighed against the &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo; and said the leak stemmed from the theft of data from the tax accounting firm Senn Ferrero. The documents taken were then &ldquo;distorted and manipulated,&rdquo; he wrote. People from Senn Ferrero also claimed that some of the documents were forgeries, though the Spanish tax attorneys didn't want to be directly quoted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;No single document revealed to have been falsified&rdquo;</div><p>EIC did all it could to determine the authenticity of the documents and neither Spiegel nor any of its partners came across any indication that the papers were either fakes or had been partially manipulated. In prior Spiegel articles stemming from the Football Leaks data trove, not a single document was revealed to have been falsified. Senn Ferrero and Osorio de Castro likewise declined to identify which documents they thought had been manipulated.</p><p>Real Madrid left most of the questions unanswered, justifying their reticence by noting that the data breach had been illegal. Furthermore, the club said, the data contained personal information about which the individuals involved had a right to comment and not the club. Real Madrid insisted that it consistently obeyed the applicable laws, noting that in cases where Real paid for image rights, the club always withheld the taxes due and transferred it to the state in accordance with Spanish law. Here, the club is likely referring to the ten per cent that was in fact paid to the tax office when Real paid the Irish company MIM for advertising with Ronaldo or Mourinho. That is why, the statement from Real continues, &ldquo;no irregularities of any kind have ever been detected&rdquo; when the club's taxes have been audited.</p><p>Former Real Madrid player Mesut &Ouml;zil has appealed against the tax penalty levied against him and his lawyer declined to comment on the case. Spanish tax authorities also didn't respond to queries on this or any other case.</p><p>In England, the London-based club Chelsea insisted that it has always obeyed prevailing law when it comes to payments for image rights, including in the case of Mourinho. English tax authorities, however, declined to give the all-clear. They indicated that they won't comment on individual cases, but added: &ldquo;HM Revenues and Customs carefully scrutinizes the arrangements between football clubs and their employees in respect of any image right payments to make sure the right tax is paid.&rdquo;</p><p>It sounds almost like a threat, and one that Mourinho would be well advised to take seriously this time. Because in the end, it won't be journalists passing final judgment on his and the others' Caribbean adventures. It will be the judiciary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read more at our <a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/football-leaks/\\\">Football Leaks</a> page</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"ac856b89-1b21-4cba-84a1-0557a542305f\"}]"}, "pk": 1255, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

No argument was too insignificant to encourage the natural parents to leave their children in the care of the state.&nbsp;</p><p>To the system, each abandoned child meant state subsidies for the institutions. Before the reform, the greater the number of children in an institution&rsquo;s care, the higher its budget. By cramming children together in giant buildings, the money for raising them was put in the hands of a single person: the director of the institution. And he helped ensure this subsidy could enrich&nbsp;his local community.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take the example of an institution for children with tuberculosis, in a remote mountain village. The entire local economy depended on the existence of that institution,&rdquo; says Andro Dadiani, a reformer in child protection in Georgia for organisation EveryChild Georgia.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The aberration of the system went so deep that the hospital for children with TB was nothing but a disguise for a state-funded foster care centre.

Overnight, the Soviet buildings &ndash; with leather-upholstered doors, endless marble corridors, garish candelabra and&nbsp;heavy wood furniture &ndash; were teeming with youngsters dressed in jeans and brandishing laptops, many of whom were former Soros Fellows in the United States.</p><p>They created labs for government strategies and established the steps of liberal reforms.

We didn&rsquo;t even have paper to write on.</p><p>\\\"That&rsquo;s where I met Tamta Golubiani. She presided over the meetings. It was impossible to not notice her. When you walked in, everything was grey and austere beyond imagination. She was sitting at one end of the table, looking at a small laptop - surrounded by pink accessories &ndash; so pink&nbsp;that you couldn&rsquo;t look away.&rdquo;</p><p>Golubiani was only 26 years old when she received a call from the new Saakashvili Government. She had just returned from the USA&nbsp;with an MA in Education from a university in New Jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly she was appointed head of the Child Protection Department, which didn&rsquo;t even exist.</p><p>&ldquo;They were in the process of creating it,&rdquo; says the reformer, now working for Save the Children. &ldquo;I started to work with an educated, persuasive, young Minister, the very opposite of any Georgian politician so far. The plan was to reform the child protection system during the three years the Government would be in power. No one knew what would come after that.&rdquo;</p><p>The think tank at the Ministry of Education laid down the Action Plan for the Children of Georgia. At the time, over 5,000 abandoned children were living in 49 orphanages built and managed on the same Soviet model spread and implemented in all neighbouring countries. The objective was to close down all the orphanages and move the children to environments that would resemble as much as possible a family.</p><p>But there was no network of alternative services to pick up the slack, so international organisations such as EveryChild, UNICEF, World Vision, Save the Children and SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages funded programmes to pioneer alternative solutions for the children who would leave the Soviet orphanages.&nbsp;</p><p>All&nbsp;this was happening in real time. Social workers were being trained, foster carers were being identified and taught, day centres were being opened and family-type homes were being built to house a maximum of eight children each.</p><p>The action plan had been in place for years, when the only entity in Georgia to put abandoned children on its agenda had been the civil society.</p><p>&ldquo;The NGOs, particularly, had tried to make their voice heard, had come up with solutions and legislative initiatives, but they had hit a political wall,&rdquo; says Golubani. &ldquo;What we did was bring together in a coherent plan resources and recipes that were already there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our plan was a stunning demonstration of how the alternative system would, in fact, work with the same costs, or even less. It wasn&rsquo;t true. In its first stage, the alternative system was twice as expensive.

But then it came up against a tough opponent for time and energy. War. Georgia against Russia&nbsp;in August 2008 over the region of Southern Ossetia. This would not end well for Georgia.</p><p>The fighting only lasted six days, but the preparation swallowed up a great part of Georgia&rsquo;s budget for several years.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 2009 that the issue of abandoned children returned in force to Georgia&rsquo;s public agenda. And it did so in style, through yet another political gesture unprecedented in the history of neighbouring states. When the American agency for international development&nbsp;USAID contacted Georgia via diplomatic channels to announce that it would send eight million dollars to&nbsp;renovate orphanages, the Health Minister at the time, Andro Urushadze, refused.&nbsp;</p><p>For this stand, many consider him a hero.&nbsp;</p><p>Urushadze approached the US Ambassador in Georgia and explained why renovating the orphanages would sound the death knell for reform.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, he asked the Ambassador to pass on the message that the money would help children if it was used to build family-type housing. The Americans agreed and, for the second time, the child protection reform was ready to be rolled out - with US money.</p><p>Urushadze wanted to de-centralise the system.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If one orphanage decided it wanted to buy ice cream for its children, it had to file an official request with the Ministry and, if it was approved, all the children in ALL the orphanages in Georgia would get exactly the same ice cream,&rdquo; says Urushadze.</p><p>&ldquo;It was much easier that way, from an accounting point of view. Everything on one bill. Same for the shoes. They decided on a model and colour and all, absolutely all the 5,180 children in the care system would get the same pair of boots that autumn.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Kids in summer, Georgia (Copyright: Save the Children)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/6..jpg\\\" style=\\\"opacity: 0.9;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Families &ldquo;paid&rdquo; to take children back</div><p>The state would give financial support to families who wished to take their children back home. Alternative services were to be outsourced to experienced NGOs &ndash; this meant training social workers and foster carers.&nbsp;</p><p>For the children who would neither return home nor placed in foster care, the state would build family-type housing.&nbsp;</p><p>To prevent abandonment, a programme would create an emergency fund for families in need. Also, for the children&rsquo;s future, two programmes were implemented: one to bring together private donors for the children&rsquo;s education, and another to manage a savings account for each child in the system, fed by the state each month until they turned eighteen and had to leave the care system.</p><p>In fewer than four years, 23 orphanages were closed. Almost 40 per cent of the children returned to their natural families, and 1,320 moved to foster care. 40 family-type homes were built, to house 314 children. Almost 100 new social workers appeared in the system.</p><p>But this was a mistake</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;I found myself opposing my own reforms&rdquo;</div><p>&ldquo;What happened was completely wrong,&rdquo; says Dadiani. &ldquo;For years I had fought like a madman for the reform, the organisation I led [EveryChild Georgia] had trained almost all the social workers and foster carers in the system, and suddenly I found myself vehemently opposing it. You can&rsquo;t close orphanages overnight! The children are not prepared! The parents are not prepared! People in the Ministry called biological parents day and night and practically threatened them to get them to come pick up their children. Sure, the results are impressive. But at what cost?&rdquo;</p><p>This scheme was too rushed. But was there any other choice?</p><p>&ldquo;The reform only stood a chance if the plan took off in full force,\\\" argues former minister Urushadze. \\\"It was the only way. And we did it, though there are many voices who cricitize the way it was done.\\\"</p><p>Now no one monitors children who have been reintegrated into their biological families - many of whom did not want to correspond with the children for years.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to know what I feel when I think back to those years? Disappointment and guilt,\\\"&nbsp;remembers Marina Shaghasvili, who led the monitoring team of the Department for Social Services, and is now the director of SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages in Georgia.&nbsp;</p><p>\\\"It&rsquo;s like they weren&rsquo;t even children, we moved them from one graph to the next so the numbers would work out. We had no time to prepare them for what would happen.\\\"</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Reforms: great on paper, not in real life</div><p>A policy of closing down orphanages is a pre-requisite the EU imposes on potential candidate countries for the bloc. Romania suffered most from the blight of abandoned children in the 1980s due to the dictator Ceausescu&rsquo;s policy against contraception and abortion - and closing institutions was one of the conditions for joining the Union.&nbsp;</p><p>For Georgia, other financial constraints brought the issue of abandoned children onto the political agenda.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, in 1998, the European Commission changed the conditions for a 20 million Euro grant as part of the Security Food Support. In the late &rsquo;90s, reforms in child protection were a way to access EU grants, a shortcut used by the government to get European money. Except the reforms only took place on paper. They looked good in summaries, but didn&rsquo;t show in the child&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Shadow child-care system: 'booming'</div><p>Officially, Georgia has almost eradicated the institutional child protection system. The only two such centers still in existence are preparing to close.&nbsp;</p><p>Unofficially, there is a boom in the grey area of child protection, off the State radar, but covering about 1,200 children in religious institutions - both Christian Orthodox and Muslim. These are unregulated. The state considers that these children need no special protection or monitoring because, on paper, they are back home, with their biological families, who look after them and protect them.&nbsp;</p><p>But these aren&rsquo;t the only institutions still operating. According to the Equal Treatment to the Schools of Faith (2016) by Partnership for Children Georgia, there are orphanages which were declared closed, but are still functioning. They changed their name, administrative structure and amended the source of financing from the state. They have also vanished from the reports on reform.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Judo training, kids from former Dusheti orphanage, Georgia.

The network of carers has grown like a big&nbsp;village, with friends and families helping each other out.&nbsp;</p><p>This is seen as the&nbsp;most successful model. Families brought each other in and created support groups. Specialists pushing for this model of child protection involved their relatives, foster care was promoted in kindergartens, and at residents'&nbsp;meetings in apartment blocks.</p><p>An informal network grew up of searching for&nbsp;potential parents willing to be paid by the state to raise abandoned children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Authorities: street children &ldquo;refugees from Azerbaidjan&rdquo;</div><p>Another layer of children invisible to the authorities are street children. This&nbsp;could be the evidence that the reform has partly failed. On paper, they also do not exist. But&nbsp;everyone can see&nbsp;the streets in the country's capital&nbsp;Tbilisi are populated by a rise in&nbsp;begging children.</p><p>However the authorities continue to claim they do&nbsp;not come from&nbsp;former orphanages, because those children have returned to their families. They&nbsp;argue that the kids&nbsp;must be refugees from Azerbaidjan, where begging is punished by law. The only official numbers on street children date back to 2008, when Save the Children and its partners made a study in only four cities and towns in Georgia and counted over 1,500.</p><p>In 2010, Maya Mgeliashvili was appointed director of the Centre for Street Children in Tbilisi.</p><p>&ldquo;I used to take children home from the centre if they asked me to. My daughter grew up with them. Nowadays you can&rsquo;t do that anymore, because of new regulations.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t believe in regulating human connections. I only believe in emotional links. They are uncontrollable, you can&rsquo;t force them, but when they do happen, they&rsquo;re real.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Now Maya has stopped working at the centre and is&nbsp;child protection services and advocacy manager for NGO World Vision Georgia. After work, she still visits the children at least two or three times a week. She estimates that&nbsp;there are at least 2,000 children living on the streets of Georgia.&nbsp;</p><p>The last remnant of the old system is the Infant House in Tbilisi &ndash; a shelter for babies and small children with special needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Time has stopped here. There are 58 cramped little beds, with barely enough room to squeeze between them, for the children lost on the way to reform.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In Georgia, children with special needs have minimal chances at living a normal life,&rdquo; says American Debbie Dunn who, after retiring, volunteered in Infant House. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been coming here for two years, working with the children daily, so I&rsquo;ve started to know them, I know what makes them laugh, what scares them. They&rsquo;ve started to expect me, they&rsquo;re happy when I walk through the door. Then, one day, they just disappear.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Without any prior warning, no time for acclimatisation, the authorities send the children either into foster care, to another&nbsp;institution for children with special needs, or put them up for international adoption.</p><p>Debbie has made a point of talking to the children in English as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Their one real chance of getting away from here is to be adopted abroad,&rdquo; she argues.</p><p>&ldquo;A year ago, I met a little blind girl. I was the first adult in her life who ever thought she might need more from life than just sitting on a carpet. I bring no accusations to the personnel here. They are overwhelmed. They barely have time to cover the children&rsquo;s primary needs. I didn&rsquo;t do much, I just went to the school for the blind, and they took her in. She started to go to school every day and she made huge progress. Before long, she was adopted by an American couple. I visited her last summer in the States. She has bloomed.&rdquo;</p><p>Debbie was an abandoned child herself. She lived in the American child protection system, separated&nbsp;from her six siblings. Some of them lived in institutions, others were put in foster care. For years she fought with her memories of the system and she still tries to repress a physical reaction to violence. Even fictional violence in movies can disturb her.</p><p>&ldquo;As a child, I tried it all,&rdquo; Debbie Dunn says. &ldquo;In America, I lived both in care institutions and in foster care. As did my brothers and sisters. Some of us would exchange the institution for foster care any time, others would do the very opposite. The experience is so personal&hellip; There is no perfect solution for abandoned children.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Translated from the Romanian&nbsp;by Anca Barbulescu</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\\\"font-size:12px;\\\"><em>This article was written with the support of the journalism grant \\\"Sprijinirea jurnali&#537;tilor din Rom&acirc;nia &icirc;n abordarea subiectelor de dezvoltare interna&#539;ional&#259;\\\" [Supporting Romanian Journalists in Approaching Subjects of International Development], a project implemented by the Federation of Non-Governmental Development Organisations (FOND/NGDO).

The twelve-year-old wonderboy took only 15 minutes at a trail session for Turkey's most successful club to convince its coaches he was special.</p><p>For the next five years, the young Arda trained with the youth squad, before making his official debut on 22 January 2005, a week before his 18th birthday. By 22, he was the club's captain and a seasoned Turkey international.</p><p>The boy from Bayrampa&#351;a had a big future. And Bulut was there to help him achieve this global stardom. For a fee.</p><p>The Turkish-German agent has been the driving force behind Arda's lucrative relocations to top Spanish teams, always steadfastly by his client's side, playing the role of the master negotiator. Arda's first ever transfer, to Atletico Madrid for 13 million Euro in 2011, ensured he became the most expensive Turkish player in history at the time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">But 13 million Euro was only the beginning</div><p>Even in these early days, deals negotiated by Bulut were suspect.</p><p>Copies of Arda's four-year employment contract, analysed by The Black Sea, show a standard salary of 2.5 million Euro per year. But in addition to the hefty bonus clauses, the document stipulates that Atletico reroute 15 per cent of his wages, untaxed, to an unnamed image rights company.</p><p>And if Arda's company is in an offshore jurisdiction with low taxation, he may have saved himself hundreds of thousands in taxes.</p><p>Spanish tax authorities are now scrutinising players&rsquo; use of images rights companies, suspecting that the schemes are facilitating tax evasion on a huge scale.</p><p>Officials at the Agencia Tributaria &ndash; the Spanish tax agency - launched investigations into several La Liga stars in recent years, including Lionel Messi, Neymar and Javier Mascherano. Not only were they forced to pay millions in back taxes to the state, the trio, and others, faced criminal charges.</p><p>In July, a Spanish court convicted Messi and his father of tax evasion and sentenced them to 21 months in prison. They served no time, but were forced to pay 3.5 million Euro in fines. Mascherano received a one year sentence. Neymar, who was convicted of fraud and made to pay 45 million Euro to Brazilian authorities, is still under investigation in Spain.</p><p>Since EIC's Football Leaks investigation kicked-off last Friday, new allegations have emerged against some of the game's biggest names. Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo, Arsenal's Mesut &Ouml;zil, and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho all appear to have exploited similar schemes, and are now under fire to provide evidence that the millions of Euro they stashed in low-tax havens were properly declared to tax authorities.</p><p>Neither Bulut or Atletico responded to questions about where Arda's image rights company is based.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Arda's contract showing 15 percent of his salary would go to an unnamed, untaxed image rights company (credit: EIC.network)\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/ARDA's%2015%20percent%20to%20image%20rights.png\\\" style=\\\"width: 550px; height: 425px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><strong>&ldquo;Never on the club's side&rdquo;</strong></div><p>Meanwhile, over the next two seasons, Arda played a leading role in the Atletico Madrid line-up and, by the summer of 2013, Bulut was lobbying for a better deal for his prized asset - and himself.</p><p>Atletico, keen to retain their star's services, convinced the Turkish captain to sign a new contract in September 2013 which media reports say increased his earnings by a million Euro a year. The agent had done his job.</p><p>Bulut claims that his success is down to his devotion to ensuring that his players &ldquo;sign the best contract&rdquo; for them.</p><p>&ldquo;That is why they pick me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;because I am never on the club's side.&rdquo;</p><p>But another previously undisclosed contract details a hidden financial arrangement between the agent and Atletico Madrid, suggesting a significant conflict of interest in the negotiations. The &ldquo;Commission Agreement&rdquo;, dated only one day after Arda signed his own contract, shows that the Spanish club agreed to pay Bulut 1.5 million Euro into an offshore account if he could &ldquo;manage and promote the negotiations so that the player ARDA TURAN&hellip; will renew his labor contract&rdquo; with them.</p><p>This lucrative side deal was prohibited under FIFA's agents&rsquo; regulations which, until it was effectively abolished in April 2015, stated clearly that &ldquo;agents may only represent the interests of one party per transaction,&rdquo; and go on to say that Bulut should not have had any &ldquo;representation contract, a cooperation agreement or shared interests&rdquo; with Atletico during the &ldquo;completion of the employment contract.&rdquo;</p><p>The 2015 changes to the conflict of interest regulations state that no conflict exists if an agent &ldquo;discloses in writing any actual or potential conflict of interest&hellip; and if he obtains the express written consent of all the other parties involved prior to the start of the relevant negotiations.&ldquo;</p><p>Bulut did not respond to questions about this deal with Atletico. The Spanish club declined to comment on whether it paid Bulut to &ldquo;manage and promote the negotiations&rdquo; in their favour, instead issuing a brief statement claiming that its affairs are &ldquo;subject to strict confidentiality.&rdquo;</p><p>Rafael Alique, spokesperson for Atletico Madrid, went on to say that &ldquo;the club expressly states that in all the cases, it has strictly fulfilled all and any of its obligations required by applicable Law at each moment, including tax Law and sports regulations.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Ahmet Bulut's side deal with Atletico Madrid (credit: EIC.network)\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/ATM%20BULUT%20CONTRACT.png\\\" style=\\\"width: 450px; height: 704px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><strong>To &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; or not to bribe</strong></div><p>If Atletico really did not intend to influence the negotiations by paying Bulut such a large fee, then the purpose of the agreement may be connected to similar cases uncovered by EIC's investigation. The reporting shows how the practice of clubs paying agent fees for player's behalf is not uncommon, and can be a way to reduce their taxes.</p><p>European clubs, like Atletico, hire their talent; players aren&rsquo;t self-employed. Arda&rsquo;s reputed salary bump to 3.5 million Euro a year is what remains after Atletico pays his income taxes. If Bulut&rsquo;s 1.5m fee was included, Arda would likely have to pay an extra 315,000 Euro to cover Spain&rsquo;s 21 per cent&nbsp;VAT.</p><p>Instead, should Atletico Madrid pay Bulut&rsquo;s commission, it can, as a business, write it off as an expense, and save Arda and itself thousands, or even millions, in the long term.</p><p>This was the case with Arsenal and former Real Madrid midfielder, Mesut &Ouml;zil, as reported by <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1253&amp;recType=story\\\">The Black Sea</a> last week. During his transfers to Real Madrid and then Arsenal, the clubs paid his agent&rsquo;s fees for him. In February this year, the Agencia Tributaria judged that these payments were an &ldquo;income advantage&rdquo; to &Ouml;zil, and that it was he, and not the clubs, who should have paid the fees &ndash;since the agent was acting on his behalf.</p><p>&Ouml;zil had to shell-out 2.17 million Euro in fines over his scheme.</p><p>Bulut's Atletico agreement also contains two other curious additions: The first requires that Atletico pay the 1.5 million Euro into an offshore account at Mashreq Bank in the United Arab Emirates, in the name of Bulut's Dubai company, Foot &amp; Ball Sport International FZE, an organisation not registered to carry out agents' activities.</p><p>Dubai's 'Free Zones' are tax-free special economic areas offering maximum confidentiality and minimum documentation to foreign entrepreneurs.</p><p>In June 2013, Bulut assisted Jorge Mendes's company Gestifute Ireland in the transfer of Bruno Eduardo Regufe Alves from Zenit St Petersburg in Russia, to Fenerbah&ccedil;e. For this, Mendes split the commission fee, and Bulut walked away with another 187,500 Euro in his Dubai account.</p><p>These offshore payments, and half a million in later fees also designated to the account, were not declared in Turkey, Bulut could have potentially saved anywhere between 4000,000 and 700,000 Euro in taxes.</p><p>Bulut did not answer respond to questions about his offshore company and tax affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><strong>&ldquo;Transfers conducted through foreign offshore companies help black money come into the system&rdquo;</strong></div><p>Tugrul Aksar, a bank manager and expert on football finance who co-founded the Football Economy Strategic Research Centre in Istanbul, told The Black Sea that these schemes are designed to launder money and make it untaxable:</p><p>&ldquo;Transfers which are conducted through foreign offshore companies help black money come into the system, but it also is one of the most effective instruments used for tax avoidance.&rdquo; He said.</p><p>&ldquo;The agency system, hand in hand with FIFA, robs from football, exploits players and corrupts the sport,&rdquo; Aksar added. &ldquo;It is the utmost structure destroying the game. The biggest sin about this belongs to FIFA.&rdquo;</p><p>Another clause in Bulut&rsquo;s contract with Atletico entitled the agent to ten per cent of Arda&rsquo;s future transfer fee, or ten per cent of any compensation payment Arda might be due if the club terminates his contract early - effectively a form of 'Third-Party-Ownership' (TPO), and against FIFA rules in force at the time.</p><p>Article 29 of the Player Agents&rsquo; regulation enacted in 2008 states clearly that agents are prohibited from &ldquo;owning any interest in any transfer compensation or future transfer value of a player.&rdquo;</p><p>Ahmet Bulut said at the time of the new deal that, &ldquo;the Spanish system requires clubs to declare a player&rsquo;s possible transfer fee and they put Arda&rsquo;s as 41 million Euro, which makes Arda the most expensive player at Atletico.&rdquo;</p><p>Sitting on a potential goldmine, it was unsurprising when a year later, at the start of the 2014/15 season, Bulut talked up a big move for his golden boy. Speaking in Turkish to a local paper in October 2014 he said, &ldquo;If a transfer is going to happen, it needs to be one of the top eight clubs in Europe. Otherwise we won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p><p>Over the next season, Arda's stock rose, and he began to pique the interest of the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea. Arda was keen on a move to England. But in May 2015, apparently unknown to Atletico or Arda, Bulut was conducting secret talks with Barcelona.</p><p>Atletico ignored the questions about its knowledge of the talks, but in later interviews, Bulut was not shy about admitting that he facilitated Barcelona's 'tapping up' Arda, the term used to describe the process of clubs or agents engineering unauthorised transfer talks, or encouraging a player to break a contract.</p><p>FIFA rules should have prohibited Barcelona approaching Arda without written permission from Atletico Madrid; for agents, FIFA kindly removed these stipulations from its Agent's' Regulations a month before the deal.</p><p>Bulut, however, likely ran afoul of Turkish Football Federation (TFF) rules with whom he is registered as an agent. Rules introduced in June 2015 state clearly that agents are not permitted to &ldquo;carry out activities that would encourage a player to terminate his professional player contract before its natural termination date. &hellip; unless the contract club has given open, written permission.&rdquo;</p><p>Rasim Artagan, media and communications executive of the TFF told the Black Sea said that the organisation&rsquo;s legal department prohibited him from commenting to the media on allegations against Bulut unless there is a court case underway.</p><p>Artagan did say that the TFF rules, applied to Bulut&rsquo;s activities, &ldquo;are official regulations, which means we have to oblige them 100%,&rdquo; but fell short of saying TFF would launch an investigation.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><strong>Arda: beats his own transfer record</strong></div><p>On 11 July, Arda became Barcelona's fourth most expensive squad player, and seventh in its history, signing a five-year contract with a four million Euro basic salary. Bulut says that Arda cried with happiness.</p><p>During an interview at Istanbul airport before flying to Barcelona, Bulut, accompanied by Arda, said, &ldquo;I was talking to Barcelona and we agreed on the transfer. A couple of weeks after this meeting, we went to Ibiza. We talked to Atletico's owner and president because they didn't want to let Arda transfer. Thankfully, they didn't want to upset Arda.&rdquo;</p><p>Arda's comment that he &ldquo;had no involvement in the transfer. This is completely the success of my manager, Ahmet&rdquo; shows the power he placed in the former goalie's hands.</p><p>Atletico President, Enrique Cerezo, said of the whole affair that there were some big companies in Turkey playing a major role in Arda&rsquo;s transfer to Barcelona. Appearing on Spanish Cadena Cope radio, he explained that &ldquo;Arda wanted to play in England. But some commercial interest and advertisement agreements prevented this. Things happened so quickly that we couldn&rsquo;t say anything. Turkey is a big country and Arda is becoming an idol. Certain circles wanted Arda to play in Barcelona and they succeeded.&rdquo;</p><p>Arda's start at the Camp Nou was stalled until January this year because of FIFA sanctions. The team was banned from purchasing new players because of breaching rules on the number of minors.</p><p>Neither party would comment whether the ten per cent transfer payment due to Bulut as per his 2013 commission agreement were ever paid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><strong>From &lsquo;worst goalie&rsquo; to &lsquo;best agent&rsquo;</strong></div><p>Bulut was born in Adana, Turkey, in 1969. Aged two, he moved with his parents to Villingen in south-west Germany, located near the border with Switzerland. It was in Switzerland where he began his career, at age 20, as a professional goalkeeper with Br&uuml;ttisellen in the Nationalliga (National League), before joining Galatasaray at 23.</p><p>By his own admission, Bulut was never going to be a superstar. Or even mediocre. In fact, he willingly describes himself as &ldquo;the worst goalkeeper in the history of Turkish football.&rdquo; Towards the end of his career, he played in Turkey's lower leagues, before retiring in 2000, aged 31. The next year, he obtained his agents' license from the Turkish Football Federation.</p><p>Bulut said that it was while at Galatasaray in his twenties that he noticed he had a gift for player management: &ldquo;A couple of my teammates were not happy with their managers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Emre [Bel&ouml;zo&#287;lu] told me, 'you should do it'. They gave me a chance, and I took it well.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2006, he was named in the UK government's 'Stevens Inquiries' into allegations of corruption in player transfers. Stevens was suspicious about Bulut's financial dealings in Emre Bel&ouml;zo&#287;lu's 3.8 million GBP transfer from Inter Milan to Newcastle United in 2005. The report said that Bulut refused to answer questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Arda Turan and Ahmet Bulut: a partnership making millions (Instagram)\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/arda%20left%20-%20bulut%20right.png\\\" style=\\\"width: 450px; height: 502px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><strong>Questionable associate in Brazil</strong></div><p>Bulut's strange dealings extend beyond his own players. In addition to his reputed close relationship with Jorge Mendes, the former goalkeeper did business with influential Brazilian agent, Eduardo Uram, and his Brazil Soccer Sports Management company based in Rio de Janeiro. Uram is a controversial figure in his homeland, and is currently part of an investigation over his some of Brazil Sport&rsquo;s questionable transfers.</p><p>Discussions between Bulut's Turkish enterprise and Brazilian Soccer reveal cross-dealings during the transfer of Uram's Brazilian footballer, Jose Fernando Viana de Santana, from Clube Atletico Paranaense (CAP) to Fenerbah&ccedil;e on 25 June last year.</p><p>According to a series of email discussions and contract negotiations between the two organisations, Bulut was again cashing-in on multiple fronts, taking money from both CAP and Fernand&atilde;o to assist in the 3.5 million Euro transfer.</p><p>For his services, Fernand&atilde;o paid Bulut 350,000 Euro - again the cash was to be paid into Foot&amp;Ball Sport International's account in Dubai. bring the total amount Bulut siphoned to his Dubai account to two million Euro in total.</p><p>From Clube Atletico Paranaense, Bulut earned a yet another fee for the same work. This contract stated that 500,000 Euro was to be paid to Bulut's Turkish organisation, Futbol Enternasyonel Men. Tur. Ins. Teks. Ltd. Sti for &ldquo;services about the signing of the transfer contract between [Fenerbah&ccedil;e] and [Paranaense] regarding the transfer of the [Fernand&atilde;o].&rdquo;</p><p>Although Uram himself took one million euro from Fenerbah&ccedil;e for the deal, there was a forth agreement in place, this time directly between the two agents. Bulut personally paid Uram &euro;200k, 40% of the commission from Clube Atletico Paranaense &ldquo;in consideration that the [Brazil Soccer &amp; Bulut] actualize the transfer of the PLAYER jointly and acted together.&rdquo;</p><p>This time, Bulut appears to be in breach of TFF rules introduced earlier that month. The new laws state that agents like Bulut &ldquo;should avoid all conflicts of interest&rdquo; and not be in any &ldquo;common interest [,] cooperation [,] or representation relationship during a transfer or contract negotiation with the opposing party of their managers,&rdquo; unless agreed in writing be all parties.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><strong>FIFA &ldquo;not taken into consideration&rdquo;</strong></div><p>For Bulut, it seems that laws and regulations that affect his work are something to be dismissed with the stroke of a pen.</p><p>All Bulut&rsquo;s professional agreements found in the Football Leaks data contain a curious clause. The contracts, seen by The Black Sea, contain a specific language dismissing FIFA's regulations, including the earlier ones with Atletico.</p><p>&ldquo;The Statutes and Regulations of FIFA, including the RSTP [Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players], and of sport federations and confederations in national and international level shall not be considered&rdquo;.</p><p>Why Bulut imposes an unenforceable clause in his contracts is revealed during a discussion last year with Uram&rsquo;s legal representative, Stefano Malvestio. Malvestio objected to its inclusion in the Fernand&atilde;o commission document.</p><p>He wrote to Sami Din&ccedil;, partner in Turkish firm Ko&ccedil;ak &amp; Din&ccedil;, Bulut&rsquo;s lawyer and legal advisor to Fenerbah&ccedil;e in late June 2015.</p><p>&ldquo;The only thing we cannot really accept under a legal point of view is that [Fernand&atilde;o] cannot sign a contract stating that the FIFA rules do not apply,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is really impossible, as he would be immediately sanctioned for that. We hope you will understand.&rdquo;</p><p>Din&ccedil; explains in the draft copies of the one of contracts that, &ldquo;the reason of not to consider the FIFA rules are that the company [Foot&amp;Ball in Dubai] is not registered before any national federation and this transaction would not been announced according to new FIFA rules [sic].&rdquo; Football clubs governed by FIFA must ensure that any agent they hire is properly accredited.</p><p>Clube Atletico Paranaense did not answer The Black Sea&rsquo;s questions, and nor did Bulut.</p><p>&ldquo;If there are multiple transactions regarding the transfer of a player and if there are secret agreements, this is hundred percent about laundering the money and/or a tax avoidance operation,&rdquo; says football finance expert Tugrul Aksar.</p><p>The specialist added that: &ldquo;FIFA still doesn&rsquo;t implement serious sanctions for these issues. Financial interests prevent certain precautions from being taken. The law remains insufficient.&rdquo;</p><p>FIFA did not wish to comment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"36c02a3c-0cec-4242-89de-82fccd8a5147\"}]"}, "pk": 1263, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Every night a shady figure came to collect its contents.</p><p>Now, on a sunny December day, the mailbox of Pastore and many other South American football stars is gone.&nbsp;</p><p>Only four drill holes are left. The manager of the building got so fed up with the bailiffs and the delivery of dozens of letters&nbsp;and demand notes, that she removed the mailbox.</p><p>Pastore&rsquo;s agent was not the only one who registered the Dam as a visiting address with the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce and the tax agency. Dozens of other companies &ndash; from car traders to constructors &ndash; and hazy foundations have their seats in this building, without its manager&rsquo;s approval.</p><p>It is no coincidence that South American transfers are settled via the Dam. Amsterdam is an ideal stop-over for global money. The Netherlands has a good reputation when it comes to international money transfers, and the supple tax agreements that have been made with nearly every country.</p><p>When it comes to football, the famed Dutch transparency exists mainly on paper, as NRC and the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) network discovered. The football companies in Amsterdam and further afield fulfil all their obligations, file their annual accounts and have a postal address.</p><p>But whoever tries to get in real contact with these companies, encounters a web of fabrications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Perfect straw men</div><p>One of the firms registered at the Dam is football agency Orel BV. Alongside&nbsp;eleven&nbsp;similar companies, it turns up frequently in Football Leaks, the trove of 18.6 million documents from the football world that NRC and EIC have investigated in the last months.</p><p>At first sight, Orel&rsquo;s director Martijn Odems (38) is a successful player agent, with a license from the Dutch football association KNVB. He is accompanied by his direct boss, fiscal lawyer Dennis Sickman (44). They seem to be the big men behind dozens of transfers of South American football stars like Pastore, Radamel Falc&atilde;o, James Rodr&iacute;guez and Angel di Maria&nbsp;to big clubs in Spain, Portugal, Italy and France.</p><p>In reality, Odems and Sickman are the perfect straw men for player agents from Argentina. Those agents want to pay as few taxes as possible from the millions they make with the transfers, and use The Netherlands as a pivot. They are assisted by Grupo Alhec, a company that is controversial in South America. It is known as &lsquo;the financier of Argentine football&rsquo;.</p><p>Odems is never in the building at the Dam. He does not pick up the phone and does not answer&nbsp; voicemails and emails from NRC. Neither can he be found at his home in Nieuw Vennep, a small town near Amsterdam.</p><p>At this address, a standard terraced house with parking bays and saplings outside, one could theoretically find Jorge Cyterszpiler, one of the most colourful figures in Argentine football. The childhood friend and former agent of Diego Maradona is one of the directors of another sports agency, based in this house in Nieuw Vennep.</p><p>The other director is Sickman, for whom this is no more than a job on the side. Sickman&rsquo;s main occupation is being director of Duma Corporate Services, a trust office at the Zuidas (Amsterdam&rsquo;s financial district) that holds dozens of companies. Martijn Odems works there as a legal advisor.</p><p>The two men are directly or indirectly involved in most of at least twelve letterbox firms, registered at home addresses or in business complexes in the small towns Nieuw Vennep and Uithoorn, or in Amsterdam. They all have nondescript names like Orel BV. The BVs tend to be controlled by men whose job is not to stand out.</p><p>At first glance, the Dutch football BVs appear to operate independently: they regularly change management and move from one address to another in Noord-Holland province. But in reality, the companies are intertwined, and Sickman's trust office Duma Corporate Services plays a central role &ndash; as revealed by research carried out by NRC.</p><p>Odems' name was mentioned previously. In 2013, NRC described how he showed up in the annual reports of FC Porto as a recipient of large sums for arranging the transfer of top striker Radamel Falc&atilde;o to Atl&eacute;tico Madrid.</p><p>Early this year, Football Leaks published confidential documents which showed that a company owned by Odems was diverting money from player transfers in Italy's Serie A to Panama.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Much of the money we pay for football disappears into agents&rsquo; pockets&rdquo;</div><p>There is a &ldquo;dark net of football money&rdquo;, says Antoine Duval, a researcher at the Asser International Sports Law Center in The Hague. &ldquo;It is a parallel world of money flows. Much of the money we all pay to watch football disappears into the pockets of agents. They do their best to minimise the tax they pay and maximise the money that goes into their secret bank accounts.&rdquo;</p><p>Avoiding transparency is an important part of that, says Duval. &ldquo;They make the chain so long that very few people can follow it, particularly because they jump from one jurisdiction to another. You see plenty of this kind of thing in the business world, and football is not immune. Football, particularly the transfer market, has become a huge financial industry.&rdquo;</p><p>Trust offices provide foreign companies and their subsidiaries with a location in the Netherlands, which they often manage on behalf of the owners. The Dutch central bank DNB requires that they comply with strict rules. For instance, they must know the origin and destination of the money which flows through the companies they manage and make certain that they are doing business with bona fide parties.</p><p>Illustrative of Duma's working method in the football world is the story of writer and poet Marco Termes, who was the director of two of these football BVs between 2009 and 2014. Termes was employed by Duma. His work involved opening the mail on behalf of the trust office for one football BV and a number of other specially established companies registered to the address of his council apartment in the coastal town of Zandvoort.</p><p>A few times a year he had to travel abroad to get football contracts signed in south Europe. The trust office provided the airline tickets and a good mid-range hotel for him and gave him the contracts to be signed. He was trusted and spoke a number of languages. Termes read all the contracts carefully, because he didn't want to get involved in anything illegal.</p><p>Because it was the perfect part-time job for him alongside writing novels and poems, Marco Termes asked few questions. At the end of 2013, his job at the trust office was suddenly terminated. The chain of football limited companies had to be rerouted, and Termes and his Zandvoort address were no longer required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Amsterdam: where accounting is a shadow game</div><p>Termes&rsquo; account is supported by e-mails and contracts in the possession of this newspaper. They provide a fascinating glimpse of the shadow accounting kept along Amsterdam's Zuidas of dozens of transfers and deals relating to Argentine, Colombian and other South American football players.</p><p>The documents reveal that all these players are paid for in Amsterdam, by men who - as far as the outside world and football fans are concerned - frequently have nothing to do with the clubs or players, but who still claim their share of the profit.</p><p>The game is played with a range of income sources: millions from image rights contracts with the sports company Nike, agency fees, investments in the economic rights of players and scouting contracts.</p><p>Football Leaks, which&nbsp;contains only part of these shadow accounts, shows that at least 30 million Euro of football money have flowed through The Netherlands to The Caribbean in the last years.</p><p>International transactions that would be highly unusual in The Netherlands, are smoothed over at the Zuidas. For instance last year, when Jorge Cyterszpiler received a cash payment of 125,000 euro by Grupo Alhec, somewhere in South America. The contracts were signed in the Uruguayan capital Montevideo, but the transaction was settled through Cyterszpiler&rsquo;s Dutch company in Nieuw Vennep &ndash; 11,000 kilometres away.</p><p>The paperwork put together along the Zuidas has an amateurish look to it. Contracts dividing up millions look as if they have been picked up off the Internet and are full of vague descriptions. They generally refer to the performance of &ldquo;certain services&rdquo; relating to football transfers. Those services are barely described, if at all, but they are remunerated very well.</p><p>There is also a continual alternation of companies, and contracts pass from firms in The Netherlands to the tax havens Panama and the British Virgin Islands. Another striking feature are deals involving players switching to new clubs on paper but never actually playing there. This is a bogus arrangement designed to evade tax, which is well-known in South America.</p><p>The Dutch tax authorities have been looking at the straw men&rsquo;s work for some time now. There are millions flowing through these companies while they do not seem to actually do anything for the money. But evidence of money laundering has not been found so far.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/101216SPEC_NL_DraaischijfENG.png\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Money flows from company in&nbsp;money-laundering probe</div><p>The Football Leaks reveal that the Dutch money flows are a one-two between Duma Corporate Services in Amsterdam and a controversial firm based in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires: Grupo Alhec, an investment company, bureau de change and bank.</p><p>Alhec has a bad reputation in South America: in 2013, a Panamanian subsidiary of the group was closed down due to suspicions of money laundering related to football transfers between Argentina and Europe. In the same year, Alhec was the focus of a large-scale money-laundering investigation by the Argentine authorities. This was a major operation, involving 150 raids on football clubs, players' agents, the Argentine FA, Alhec and even the Argentine central bank.</p><p>The suspicion was that European clubs were paying more for players and agency fees than was shown in the invoices, and that the surplus was reaching the Argentines tax-free via complicated routes, including the Netherlands. As part of the investigation, a telephone call between Cyterszpiler and Carlos Rivera, one of the owners of Alhec, was tapped. In that conversation, which was broadcast on Argentine television, Rivera suggested to Cyterszpiler to persuade a player in Argentina to engage in match fixing.</p><p>Neither Alhec, Cyterszpiler or anyone else has been prosecuted to date. A court ruled that the judicial investigation had not been conducted with due care and replaced the examining magistrate. According to Argentine media, the new examining magistrate is currently investigating over 400 football transfers.</p><p>Cyterszpiler is not the only players' agent making use of the Dutch route. At least four other well-known Argentine agents are doing the same, in most cases in partnership with Alhec. The most prominent among them is Marcelo Simonian, one of the biggest agents in South America, who represents players like Pastore and Falc&atilde;o. His partnership with Alhec is highly intensive, the documents reveal.</p><p>In an e-mail exchange with Alhec chief Rivera, one of the other agents makes clear that tax avoidance is the prime reason for using a Dutch private limited company. Initially he is still undecided as to whether to choose a route via the Netherlands or Spain. Then, opting for the Netherlands, he writes: &ldquo;As long as no tax is levied, it's fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"British Virgin Islands offers more discretion than Panama\\\"</div><p>Until mid-2013, the payments via the Netherlands took place reasonably openly, but immediately after the actions by the Argentine judicial authorities, Alhec decided to henceforth operate under the radar. The details show that following the raids, Alhec switched to a trust office in Uruguay which has since been involved in all its business.</p><p>This office, BGL Asesores, takes care of the paperwork. Correspondence about the football business routed through Dutch BVs has since been conducted by hushmail, a secure e-mail program that is hard for law enforcement authorities to crack. Those involved no longer refer to each other by name in the e-mails but instead use aliases, abbreviations and numbers.</p><p>Most of the constructions using the Netherlands are devised in Buenos Aires or Montevideo and effectuated in Amsterdam. The main language is Spanish and the millions of euros in profits end up with companies in Panama or, since 2013, the British Virgin Islands. There, a company called Paros Consulting is used, that now functions as a treasure chamber.</p><p>The discretion which the Virgin Islands offer companies is even greater than in Panama. In both countries, companies do not need to submit annual accounts and shareholders can remain secret. However, on the Virgin Islands the directors also remain anonymous.</p><p>Who owns Paros is unclear. But Rivera does refer to Paros as &ldquo;my company&rdquo; in an e-mail. And in the e-mail exchanges with BGL and others, he takes crucial decisions on Paros. Football Leaks do not contain decisive evidence, but it is highly likely that agents like Simonian ultimately get their money from Paros after all the intermediate steps.</p><p>Why all the detours? Why for instance does FC Porto, that works with Simonian intensively, not transfer the agent's fee directly to Argentina?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to lie! I only lie to my wife!&rdquo;&nbsp;</div><p>According to Simonian, the only one of the Argentine bankers and agents who responded to questions from this newspaper and EIC, even the slightest reference to tax evasion is a scandalous accusation.</p><p>&ldquo;I am the biggest tax payer in the Argentine football world&rdquo;, he shouts into the phone. &ldquo;I pay all my taxes. Are you paying the bill for this phone call? I am very poor because I have to pay all these taxes!&rdquo;</p><p>Simonian says he has never heard of Paros. Neither of Orel.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to lie!&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;I only lie to my wife!&rdquo;</p><p>In his view, Carlos Rivera is &ldquo;a banker who has had a very good reputation for a very long time in Argentina.&rdquo; And yes, Simonian does business with him occasionally. &ldquo;Small things&rdquo;, like changing money, or &ldquo;some investments&rdquo;.</p><p>From Portugal comes a different perspective. &ldquo;Orel was the company named by Mr. Simonian for the intermediation&rdquo; in the transfer of the Columbian player James Rodr&iacute;guez, FC Porto says in a reaction. An e-mail from Porto in the Football Leaks also states that Simonian appointed Orel as the club&rsquo;s business partner when Falc&atilde;o came to Porto.</p><p>No, she has &ldquo;never heard of&rdquo; Dennis Sickman. And Martijn Odems? &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know him&rdquo;, says the receptionist of a tax advisory office on the ninth floor of a large office building on the Amsterdam Zuidas. According to contracts in the Football Leaks, the trust office Duma Corporate Services is based here. The receptionist is obviously struggling to keep a straight face. &ldquo;Duma? That doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell at all.&rdquo;</p><p>Then a door opens behind her, and a big man enters the corridor, while the receptionist continues denying. The big man is Dennis Sickman, director of Duma and Dutch straw man-in-chief of Argentine football.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you please leave the premises?&rdquo;, he says in a demanding tone. He moves in front of the receptionist to show his unexpected visitors the door. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t comment.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"In the three years James Rodriguez played for Porto his value increased from five to 45 million Euro - a splendid investment\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/GettyImages-621075722.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 1000px; height: 665px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">World Cup hero James Rodr&iacute;guez transfer: a textbook sleight of hand using Dutch firms</div><p>The transfer of the Colombian midfielder James Rodr&iacute;guez, top scorer at the last World Cup in Brazil, is a prime example of the sleight of hand involving Dutch limited companies &ndash; designed to channel millions from Portugal, via the Netherlands, to tax havens in the Caribbean, tax-free and with no awkward questions.</p><p>In recent months, Rodr&iacute;guez has been mostly warming the bench at Real Madrid, but in 2011 he arrived at FC Porto as an outstanding, 18-year old prospect from the Argentine side Banfield. In the three years he played for&nbsp;Porto his value increased from five to 45 million Euro, a splendid investment. Marcelo Simonian, one of the biggest player&rsquo;s agents in South America, was an intermediary in Rodr&iacute;guez transfer to Porto. Simonian uses Dutch letterbox firms for all contracts with European clubs.</p><p>For Rodr&iacute;guez' move to Porto, a construction was set up that made it appear as if not he but the Dutch firm Orel BV had put together the deal. In the summer of 2010, a year before the transfer, Orel director Martijn Odems signed a contract for this with a company based in Panama, Braden Enterprises.</p><p>Kresimir Juan Bielic, an Argentine born in the former Yugoslavia, signed on behalf of Braden. Together with Carlos Rivera, he owns Alhec. It is a remarkable contract: Orel outsourced the negotiations with Banfield (Rodriguez' club) to Braden, which received 94 percent of the proceeds in return &ndash; nearly the entire sum paid by Porto in agents' fees. The remaining six per cent were presumably for Orel.</p><p>A year later, Braden transferred the contract with Orel to another Panamanian company: Global Specialty Trading (GST). Bielic signed this contract on behalf of both Braden and GST. Then, in November 2013, the contract with the Dutch firm Orel again changed hands: this time, Orel promised to transfer the money to Paros Consulting, based in the British Virgin Islands. Porto states it does not know the Caribbean companies.</p><p>Rodr&iacute;guez had by now won a Portuguese Player of the Year award and had left for AS Monaco for a transfer fee of 45 million euro. Orel was entitled to ten per cent of the transfer money. It is unknown if Simonian is the ultimate beneficiary.</p><p>In January 2014, Orel received an invoice from Paros requiring it to transfer 4,121,185.13 Euro to Paros' bank account in Lichtenstein, for &ldquo;services&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Porto-Orel transaction&rdquo; in connection with &ldquo;the football player J. Rodr&iacute;guez&rdquo;. In this way, Orel ultimately handed over the bulk of the earnings.</p><div>&nbsp;</div></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"ef40013e-f759-4200-8225-9bab73d5b9e9\"}]"}, "pk": 1264, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Seven days a week, he sets the alarm, turns on the computer and continues working on his next manuscript.</p><p>&ldquo;I literally write myself to into the ground,&rdquo; he says. His work rate is incredible. In a couple of years, he wrote eight novels, short stories, thousands of aphorisms and three books of verse.</p><p>Termes is also a real straw man. Between 2009 and the end of 2013, his social housing apartment on Zeestraat in Zandvoort was the address of a company - Convergence Capital Partners BV - involved in international football&rsquo;s top leagues (he directed a second one, based in a nearby municipality).&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011, this company had 30 per cent ownership on paper of the Colombian professional footballer James Rodr&iacute;guez, who then played for FC Porto. Director: M.A Termes.</p><p>Not that he ever met the Columbian midfielder or watched him practise his half volleys on a training ground. But he did have dealings with the millions earned by Rodr&iacute;guez.</p><p>He&rsquo;s an Ajax supporter, because his father once took him to De Meer stadium in Amsterdam and he liked the creative match play of the Amsterdam team. He sometimes watches football on television, also to give him something to talk about in the beach resort, where residents have little interest in literature. But ultimately, football is a side issue, says Termes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing really excites me, except writing. The rest is bullshit.&rdquo;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Straw man job: only ten hours a week&rdquo;</div><p>At the end of 2008, a friend asked if he might be interested in a job with a trust company in Amsterdam. The job description: he&rsquo;d be director of a number of companies which would be registered at his address. He would handle the post, go along to meetings if the trust company called and travel as a representative of the companies to collect signatures in south Europe.</p><p>Termes had his reasons for taking the job. In 2006, he had promised to spend the rest of his life working as a writer &ndash; but sold very few books. In order to achieve his sacred mission, the job at the trust company was ideal: he worked from home and the poet spent no more than ten hours a week on the job.</p><p>In early 2009, the first company was registered at his address, Creatermes &ndash; an &ldquo;organisational consultancy&rdquo; operating &ldquo;in the field of media and telecommunications&rdquo;. The formation expenses were paid by the trust company and the shares paid up. The Polish chocolate factories of E. Wedel, which were based in the Netherlands for tax reasons, were also registered at his address.</p><p>The footballers came soon. Through the trust, three Argentinian football talents, then aged 15, 16 and 18, authorised Termes to sell them to a football club anywhere in the world and the trust would keep the proceeds. Termes retained his salary.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;I was destined to be a writer&rdquo;</div><p>Marco Termes wrote his first poems at the age of thirteen and four years later, he knew for certain: he was destined to become a writer. His parents gave him every freedom. They had a restaurant, Terminus, on the beach at Zandvoort. His father combined that job with being a councillor for the coastal municipality.</p><p>He wrote his first novel, the philosophical thriller Tyrannosaurus Regina, when he was seventeen &ndash; about the fictional character Tamara Raziani, a beautiful and intelligent banker&rsquo;s daughter. Six years later, he put down his pen. He felt that the publishing world was too commercial and he was annoyed at his lack of real life experience. First he had to live a bit to &ldquo;experience things to write about.&rdquo;</p><p>Termes was a handsome boy - and he was fit. He modelled in fashion shows and danced at the World Disco Dancing Championships in London in 1978. He spent five years as a background dancer at the public broadcasting channel Avro. An adventure as a singer in a boy band - an idea mooted by the producers of 80s Dutch sextet Dolly Dots &ndash; went nowhere, but his contacts in the media did get him a contract as a hand model.</p><p>For fifteen years, his perfect hands adorned advertisements for beer, watches and packs of washing powder. In the meantime, he worked as a contractor, barman, petrol pump attendant, quiz question maker and caterer &ndash; until at the age of forty, he washed up in the Cypriot capital of Nicosia where he was tapped on the shoulder by a 24 year-old Russian beauty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Here was the woman I had written about when I was 17&rdquo;</div><p>&ldquo;Have you been waiting long for me?&rdquo; she asked, and he knew at once: this was Tamara Raziani, the woman who had starred in his first novel &ndash; but now in real life.</p><p>&ldquo;Twice in my life, my novels have crossed with my own reality,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The first time was in Nicosia. I was dumbstruck. That was the woman &ndash; the woman I&rsquo;d written about as a 17 year old boy. Two hours later, I asked her to marry me.&rdquo;</p><p>For six years, the writer was married to the Russian Lillia. They lived together in a tiny apartment in St Petersburg and later on Zeestraat in Zandvoort, but their love didn&rsquo;t last. Lillia now lives in Amsterdam, has two young children with another man and doesn&rsquo;t want any contact with Termes. But she is and will always be his muse. He turns down other women and has recently had her tattooed on his chest and leg.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><span style=\\\"color: rgb(116, 192, 226); font-weight: bold;\\\">&ldquo;The trust instructed me to go to Lazio Roma&rdquo;</span></div><p>The second time fact and fiction coincided was around five years later, when Termes was dispatched with another stack of football contracts. He&rsquo;d collected his instructions from the trust company on the Zuidas in Amsterdam, got a plane ticket and &ndash; suited and booted &ndash; had flown to Rome. There he had to collect signatures from the board of Lazio Roma.</p><p>To his amazement, the club&rsquo;s offices were in a building that had played an important role in the novel he wrote when he was 17.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In the hall, by the door of the office of Lazio&rsquo;s chairman, was a statue of the god Ajax,&rdquo; says the writer. &ldquo;Ajax was my club &ndash; and I asked the secretary if she could take a photo of me with the disposable camera I&rsquo;d bought at the pharmacy.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s kept the photo of Marco Termes, the football straw man who walked into his own debut novel. Just like the skirt that Lillian was wearing that evening in Nicosia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;I turned from a value to a cost&rdquo;</div><p>The &ldquo;ideal part time job&rdquo; at the trust company lasted until the end of 2013. From one day to the next, he changed from &ldquo;something of value to a cost item&rdquo; and his contract was terminated. The fact that Dutch football companies were being intensively investigated by the Argentinian prosecutors in that period means nothing to him.</p><p>&ldquo;In my years with the trust company, I had to sign and read all the contracts and papers,&rdquo; says Termes. &ldquo;As far as I could see, everything was above board, but I only saw a small piece of the puzzle. It was like being in a room divided by a heavy curtain. Plans were made on one side of the curtain and I was on the other. Sometimes a piece of paper was pushed through the curtain, which I then had to do something with.&rdquo;</p><p>He won&rsquo;t go into more details.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all accountants, who operate in an extremely closed world. I signed a confidentiality agreement and maybe I&rsquo;ve said too much already. That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m honest through and through and because the business world really doesn&rsquo;t interest me.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s not angry with the men who made him director of two football companies and then let him go. In fact, he is rather grateful.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I was able to devote four years of my life to my writing and experienced things which gave me things to write about. I was a goldfish in a bowl of piranhas.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"08453d6d-1240-4caa-b332-50fe9d6d13bc\"}]"}, "pk": 1265, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Pogba got off to a poor start with Manchester United at the beginning of the season. He failed to make an impact in the club&rsquo;s derby with Manchester City, and again in a Europa League tie with Dutch team Feyenoord in mid-September.&nbsp;</p><p>United&rsquo;s manager Jos&eacute; Mourinho was forced onto the defensive over the sum paid by the club.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I just want Paul to forget that and to play his football,&rdquo; said the Portuguese boss.&nbsp;</p><p>While the young Frenchman made an impressive display for his country in a World Cup qualifying match against Holland in October, when he marked the winning goal, he has become something of a scapegoat for his club&rsquo;s disappointing results in the Premier League. Some fans even took to Twitter to debate his performances under the hashtags &ldquo;#Pogfraud&rdquo; and &ldquo;#Pogshit&rdquo;.</p><p>Pogba&rsquo;s dip in form in the game is set against a background of sordid business dealings off the field, marked by greed, dubious deals and tax havens. It is a story that features a ferocious battle between Oualid Tanazefti, a Frenchman who first discovered Pogba&rsquo;s talent when the latter was aged just 13, and the heavyweight agent Mino Raiola.</p><p>L&rsquo;Equipe and the investigative programme Canal + show Enqu&ecirc;tes de Foot have already investigated the rivalry between Tanazefti and Raiola.</p><p>But new explosive documents obtained by Mediapart and German weekly magazine Der Spiegel &ndash; and passed on to the journalistic collective European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) &ndash; demonstrate the vast lengths the two men were ready to go to in order to obtain the wealthy returns from Pogba&rsquo;s golden feet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Tanazefti \\\"appropriated for himself the revenue\\\"&nbsp;</div><p>Our documents show how Paul Pogba was first exploited by Tanazefti in 2014, when the agent convinced him to sign a one-sided contract in which Tanazefti appropriated for himself the revenue from the player&rsquo;s image rights over a period of 15 years via a Luxembourg company.&nbsp;</p><p>Subsequently, when Mino Raiola managed to organise a buyout of the rights, he transferred the &ldquo;Paul Pogba&rdquo; brand to an offshore shell company, created in Jersey shortly before the sponsoring deal with Adidas was signed.&nbsp;</p><p>This raises questions as to whether this was a platform for tax evasion. But Raiola would not respond to questions on the issue.</p><p>Our investigation also reveals that Juventus paid to Mino Raiola ten million Euro of commissions during the four seasons spent by Pogba in Torino, almost as much as the cumulated player's salary.</p><p>With the 27 million Euro transfer commission on top, the superagent clocked up a skyrocketing 37 million Euro from Juventus between 2012 and 2016.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Two children of immigrants on the road to riches</div><p>The story begins with Oualid Tanazefi, the son of Moroccans born in Mantes-la-Jolie, a poor and immigrant-populated town of greater Paris.&nbsp;</p><p>In his teens Tanazefi had hopes of becoming a professional footballer. After humble beginnings playing for small clubs in Normandy, an injury he suffered at the age of 18 ended his hopes of a career. Soon after he became a scout for modest French Ligue 1 team Le Havre, who assigned him to seek out young talent in the Paris region.</p><p>In 2006, during his scouting work, Tanazefti, then 21, came across Paul Pogba, a promising kid aged 13. The two had similar backgrounds: Pogba, born in France to Guinean parents, grew up, like Tanazefti, in a difficult social environment in a housing estate in the eastern Paris suburbs, the &lsquo;Cit&eacute; de la Renardi&egrave;re&rsquo; in Roissy-en-Brie.&nbsp;</p><p>Tanazefti was instrumental in Pogba&rsquo;s admission to the youth training centre of Le Havre. Two years later, Pogba was called up to play in France&rsquo;s national under-16 team.</p><p>In the summer of 2009, Pogba, by then aged 16, became old enough to sign his first cadet contract with Le Havre. But Tanazefti, who was still a scout for Le Havre but had also become a self-styled advisor to Pogba, convinced the boy to join the youth academy of Manchester United.&nbsp;</p><p>Le Havre denounced the move by United, accusing it of violating an exclusivity agreement between the French club and the young player, and alleging it had offered Pogba&rsquo;s parents &ldquo;very large sums of money&rdquo; to ensure one of its &ldquo;best youngsters&rdquo; accepted the move. The dispute was eventually resolved in a financial deal between the two clubs which has never been public.</p><p>Tanazefti resigned from his job with Le Havre and moved with Pogba to England.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;I educated him like my son\\\"</div><p>&ldquo;I spent three years with him in Manchester,&rdquo; Tanazefti would later recall. &ldquo;It was sometimes difficult because we didn&rsquo;t have much money.&rdquo; It was during those three years that a special relationship developed between the young Pogba, distanced from his family at the age of 16, and his &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; who took on a role somewhere between that of an elder brother and a substitute father.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I educated him like my son, in the same way that my father educated me,&rdquo; Tanazefti told French journalists Antoine Grynbaum and St&eacute;phane Bitton in an interview published in their book &ldquo;The secrets of the transfer market&rdquo;.</p><p>During the summer of 2011, after Pogba had turned 18, the young Frenchman signed his first professional contract with Manchester United, which was for a 12-month period. Along with two partners, Tanazefi then set up a football agent&rsquo;s business called Sporteam, based in the southern French city of Aix-en-Provence.</p><p>But without an agent&rsquo;s licence, and with only one football player under his wings, Tanazefi knew that he was little in the face of Manchester United, one of the world&rsquo;s wealthiest clubs, then led by the mighty Sir Alex Ferguson. For that reason he turned for help to Mino Raiola, already one of the world&rsquo;s most influential football agents, whose list of clients included Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Italian striker Mario Ballotelli.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;I did what was best for my client&rdquo;</div><p>After just one year with Manchester United, and following strained relations with Ferguson, Pogba left the club for Juventus. Pogba complained that Ferguson had included him in just seven matches during the season, while Ferguson, who tried to dissuade him from the move, would later, in his book of memoirs, criticise Raiola, accusing the Monaco-based agent of manoeuvring behind the manager&rsquo;s back and seeking too much financial reward. &ldquo;I did what was best for my client,&rdquo; Raiola said of the events.</p><p>It is true that the agent obtained from Juventus for the 19 year-old Pogba an annual salary which was comparatively huge for a player of his age: 2.75 million Euro (bonuses included), which makes around 1.5 million Euro net of taxes. After two seasons, Raiola helped to raise Pogba's salary to a net 4.5 million per year, according to press reports. So the player cashed a total of around 12 millions from Juventus. But the agent also negotiated a very good deal for himself.</p><p>As Pogba arrived as a free player, with no transfer fee to be paid by Juventus, Raiola seized the opportunity to empty the club's bank account. According to official Juventus documents analysed by EIC, Juventus paid ten million Euro of agent's fees related to Pogba in four years! That's almost as much as the player's salary. What has been the justification of this huge amount? Raiola would not answer questions on this issue.</p><p>It is unclear whether Oualid Tanazefti, Pogba's historic advisor, knew about the deal negotiated by his partner Raiola. But as soon as the player went to Torino, their alliance had begun to fall apart. On 3 August 2012, Juventus had called the press to witness the signing of Pogba. Alongside Pogba on the press conference stand, Tanazefti asked &ldquo;Mino&rdquo; to join them for the photo call. But upon leaving the room, Tanazefti made a joke that appeared to displease Pogba.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, leave him,&rdquo; interjected Raiola, walking out with Pogba and addressing Tanazefti with a mocking &ldquo;Ciao, ciao&rdquo;.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">A marriage of three</div><p>So Pogba had acquired an official agent in the form of Raiola, and an &ldquo;advisor&rdquo;, who was Tanazefti. The latter was sometimes a little too close to Pogba for comfort. In March 2013, for his first selection with the senior French national team, Pogba arrived at the training base at Clairefontaine accompanied by Tanazefti. The agent tried to enter the premises with him, and was soon escorted outside. France coach Didier Deschamps summoned Pogba to his office to tell him that there should never be a repeat of the incident.</p><p>While Tanazefti was trying to penetrate the sanctuary of the French football elite, Raiola was already fuelling speculation.</p><p>&ldquo;If Bale [Welsh striker Gareth Bale bought by Real Madrid] is worth 100 million euros, Pogba is worth at least double that. (&hellip;) Pogba is, for me, a Salvador Dali because he is precious and important,&rdquo; the agent told Sky Sport Italia in August 2013.</p><p>Raiola had a personal interest in exaggerating. When he had brought Pogba to Juventus, he had negotiated a golden share on his future transfer, recently disclosed by Juventus CEO Giuseppe Marotta: the agent would get 18 million if Pogba is sold 90 million, plus a big percentage on sums over 90 million. That's how he would get the 27 million Euro for Pogba's return to Manchester.</p><p>When he raised the 200 million Euro figure on TV, Raiola already knew that he could score big, as the French player&rsquo;s talent and worth blossomed with Juventus. In Summer 2013, just after he won his first Italian title with Juventus, he was part of the French national team that won the Fifa under-20s World Cup.</p><p>That same year he was awarded the Golden Boy award for the best under-21 footballer in Europe. One year after, he won a second national title and took par to the the 2014 World Cup. It had been his first major tournament with the France national senior team, for which he was awarded Fifa&rsquo;s Best Young Player title.</p><p><img alt=\\\"Pogba: the world's most expensive player has yet to shine bright for new club Manchester United (GSP/Getty)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Pogba%20Getty.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 1000px; height: 648px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Pogboom&rdquo;&nbsp;a marketing icon</div><p>The rising star was not only shining on the field. His laid-back attitude, his youth and haircut, not to mention what became his cult &ldquo;Pogdance&rdquo; display before matches, made him a huge hit with the Juventus fans. &ldquo;Pogboom&rdquo; had soon become a marketing icon, one of the rare players able to obtain a ten-figure contract with a sportswear company.</p><p>In 2014, on the contrary, his first &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; Oualid Tanazefti was in difficulty. His football agent firm Sporteam had turned into a fiasco, and he winded down the business after it had posted a turnover of only 22,000 Euro in two years. Meanwhile, Pogba&rsquo;s relations with Mino Raiola were ever closer, and the heavyweight agent was now involved in all the negotiations involving the player.</p><p>Tanazefti had just one card left to further his ambition of striking gold, namely image rights. In their book La bande &agrave; Deschamps, French journalists Damien Degorre and Rapha&euml;l Raymond wrote that on the eve of the 2014 World Cup, Pogba was &ldquo;the only French international player who had not signed a contract with a sportswear supplier because his advisor reckoned he had received no acceptable offer&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>The journalists reported that he had turned down an offer from Nike worth an annual 900,000 Euro. &ldquo;During the World Cup, Pogba wore Nikes because he liked the look of the boots, without being remunerated,&rdquo; they wrote. &ldquo;The British sportswear firm Umbro, lying in ambush, offered him a contract worth one million Euro per year. But in July 2014, nothing was yet signed.&rdquo;</p><p>It is unclear whether Tanazefti was about to broker a big deal, but what is certain is that four months later, he convinced Pogba to sell to him his image rights.&nbsp;</p><p>To complete the operation, Tanazefti teamed up with one of his old associates in Sporteam, Ylli Kullashi, then aged 34. Son of a Kosovar refugee, Kullashi arrived at the age of 12 in France, where he grew up in a housing project in a poor suburb of north-east of Paris, Kullashi went on to study law and subsequently acquired a licence to act as a football agent.</p><p>The two men signed the deal with Pogba on 5 November 2014. That contract, revealed&nbsp;for the first time, was incredibly unfavourable for the player, who was perhaps blind to the situation because of the confidence he had in his mentor. Manifestly, they took advantage of the Juventus star.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Pogba would only receive his share of image rights \\\"after 15 years\\\"</div><p>Tanazefti bought 60 per cent of Pogba&rsquo;s image rights and Kullashi 40 per cent, for a total price that had to be fixed between 1.8 million euros and five million euros, payable in five instalments. The first of these was due only in June 2015, seven months after the signature. The pair therefore handed over a maximum of one million Euro upfront, and which they were certain to swiftly recover.</p><p>The contract allowed for Pogba to receive 70 per cent of the value of rights sold, while Tanazefti and Kullashi were to receive 30 per cent. But it stipulated that Tanazefti and Kullashi would be paid their share as soon as money from the sponsoring deals hit the account, while Pogba would only begin to receive his share after 15 years, &ldquo;at the earliest on 31 October 2029&rdquo;.</p><p>All that the footballer was granted is a yearly fee payment to be negotiated separately &ldquo;in good faith&rdquo;&hellip; but that was not to exceed 33,000 Euro.</p><p>During the 15 years that Pogba would receive almost no payment of his share in the rights deals, Tanazefti and Kullashi were free to invest the money due to him as they thought fit. Furthermore, when he would finally receive his payment, in October 2029, he was bound to repay to the two men the sum they themselves paid to him to acquire the rights (1.8 -five million Euro), as well as their salaries and expenses for brokering sponsorship deals.</p><p>Lastly, but not least, Tanazefti and Kullashi were allowed to sell on Pogba&rsquo;s image rights without his approval, with the only condition of remaining &ldquo;associates&rdquo;, even with a minority status, of the new rights owner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Mino Raiola was \\\"furious\\\" with deal</div><p>The pair had also set up a structure to reduce their tax liability. When they were involved together in Sporteam, both were French residents. But the day they closed the the deal with Pogba, Tanazefti had adopted residency in Morocco, while Kullashi became a resident of Kosovo.</p><p>The contract has been signed in Turin, but came under Luxembourg law. And three months after the deal was struck, the pair created a Luxembourg-based company called Koyot Group which was to manage the sale of the player&rsquo;s image rights.</p><p>Mino Raiola soon discovered the existence of the deal, and was furious, as was also Paul Pogba, when he at last understood the consequences. The player broke off his relations with Tanazefti in December 2014, one month after signing. From then on, it was open war between Raiola and Tanazefti, fought via their lawyers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Tanazefti tried to sell player's rights \\\"behind his back\\\"</div><p>Raiola&rsquo;s first counter-attack was launched in March 2015. That was when an Italian lawyer, writing as Pogba&rsquo;s representative, contacted the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), requesting that the trademark Paul Pogba be transferred to an Irish company, Blue Brands Limited. The declared activity of the company, a shell structure which belongs to a local trust company, is that of &ldquo;providing nominee services&rdquo;.</p><p>Tanazefti, as owner of the trademark, attempted to contest the move, but the EUIPO refused to become involved in the dispute which it said should be settled in a court of law. The result was that Tanazefti and Kullashi could not use the trademark, but neither could Raiola.</p><p>The problem was that without the image rights, it was impossible to envisage signing up with a major football club. Tanazefti therefore had powerful leverage, which he intended to use to maximum benefit. It was because of this blockage that Pogba was unable to leave Juventus during the transfer window of the summer of 2015, even though he was sought after by several major clubs, including Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.</p><p>Press reports claimed that Tanazefti offered to unblock the situation in exchange for 15 million Euro, but Raiola refused.</p><p>Football Leaks documents suggest that Tanazefti then tried to sell the rights behind the player&rsquo;s back. He began by contacting a London-based investment firm, Doyen Sports, and met with its management in the British capital on 19 November 2015. Just before the meeting, a Spanish lawyer for the firm expressed his surprise at Tanazefti&rsquo;s move: &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Pogba work with the pizzaiolo Mino Raiola?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Doyen Sports turned down the offer, apparently because it was worried about damaging its relations with Raiola, but also because even with the law on its side it would be very difficult to use a player&rsquo;s image rights if he does not agree to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Mendes team dissuaded Chinese on questionable Pogba deal&rdquo;</div><p>But Tanazefti continued with his project, approaching a British intermediary who relayed his proposition to Chinese investment group Fosun, which was initially interested, believing that Raiola was behind the deal on offer. It contacted the Portuguese player agent Jorge Mendes, a leading figure in the business, to find out more. But Mendes, who had also been proposed the deal, dissuaded the Chinese.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Please be careful with the Pogba image rights situation - it's pretty tricky, we know this issue very well&rdquo;, wrote the agent's right hand man to Fosun.</p><p>In the world of football, the golden business opportunities with Pogba could not remain on hold for long. On 16 March 2016, German sportswear giant Adidas announced it had struck a deal with the player, estimated to be worth between 25 to 40 million Euro over ten years, including the marketing of a line of football shoes carrying Pogba&rsquo;s name.</p><p>Two weeks later, French sports daily L&rsquo;Equipe reported that the deal, brokered by Raiola, was made possible only after the agent arranged the buyout of Pogba's rights for ten million Euro. Which makes five million each for Ylli Kullashi and Oualid Tanazefi. The detail of the agreement remains a mystery, including the question of whether Pogba was himself capable of handing over ten million euros, and whether he had truly re-acquired all his rights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Jersey: home of the Paul Pogba brand</div><p>The structure that closed the deal is also shrouded in darkness. We can reveal today that the Paul Pogba trademark does not directly belong to the player, but to an offshore shell company called Aftermath Limited, registered in Jersey, the famous Channel Island tax haven. The real owner of Aftermath is hidden behind a nominee shareholder - the local corporate services provider Whitmill Nominees.</p><p>Aftermath Limited was set up on 4 February 2016, one month before the deal with Adidas was announced. At the time, The Paul Pogba trademark was registered with Blue Brands, the Irish company created by Raiola during his dispute with Tanazefti.</p><p>On 15 July 2016, an Italian lawyer wrote to the European Intellectual Property Office to register the transfer of the trademark to Aftermath. However, the Paul Pogba trademark registered in France, and the international Paul Pogba trademark applicable for markets in the United States and China, remain the property of Blue Brands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"991af38c-5438-4c5c-b566-45b806573340\"}]"}, "pk": 1267, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

She started out as a domestic, looking after an old couple for two years. When they died, she used her connections to get another job, before landing work in outreach with&nbsp;Dedalus.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">She understands the situation women from Romania find themselves in: girls come to Italy and care for old people day and night, but the pensioners can die after two weeks - and the women have nowhere to live.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;In three or four days you&rsquo;re by yourself, with no money, no papers, nothing. When you don&rsquo;t know anyone, you&rsquo;re starving, if you&rsquo;re not very smart or you're desperate, and you don&rsquo;t have time to know the language, a pimp will immediately pick you up. When I see these girls, I often think: &lsquo;My God, I was so lucky&rsquo;. Because it's very easy to slip into this.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Outside the HQ of a political voting movement demanding absenteeism are painted words in giant letters &lsquo;Non-Votare&rsquo;. This is where a stocky late 30-someting&nbsp;Bulgarian stays with an Italian trans friend. The Bulgarian complains to Carmen that since she brought her three children to Italy, they have started misbehaving at school and at home. The trans shakes her head in concern.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Further down the street is a parade of giant inflatable toys. By day, a vendor sells these to visitors to the seaside. He he has left the plastic ducks, sharks, dolphins and paddling pools on the street, confident no one will steal them. They are now the nocturnal backdrop to an Albanian in a push-up bra and miniskirt.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In an crossroads between two open plains is a mass of loud Nigerian women.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;They stay in groups,&rdquo; says Carmen, &ldquo;and have quick, sexual relations for as little as five Euro.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Many are trafficked in loan shark scams, so are in debt at home in Nigeria. Once they pay their debts, they are free, so they trying to attract as many clients as possible.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;This takes them two to three years,&rdquo; says Carmen.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Nigerians are lowering the prices, and there is some tension among the other sex workers.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Another girl, Sara, also from Calarasi, stands under a flyover, below a sign warning drivers that if their vehicle is over 4.4 metres it will smack into the bridge overhead. Carmen talks to her. She says that once she owned a restaurant in Naples and wants to start this business again. Until then, she is looking forward to a vacation, somewhere in the Romanian mountains.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Under the flyover a battered Fiat is parked with its hazard lights on. A man in his late 50s, crouched, is waiting inside. Sara wants to talk. More. She won&rsquo;t stop.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you worried you will lose clients?&rdquo; asks Carmen.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;This one,&rdquo; she gestures to the old man, &ldquo;is used to waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Normally you would have faith in&nbsp;your brother, if he tells&nbsp;you &lsquo;Come to Italy&rsquo;&rdquo;</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Carmen visits the street three times a week. When she began in 2009 there were mostly Albanians, then came the Romanians, from the cities of Calarasi, Bucharest, Craiova and Bacau. The majority start working as prostitutes when they are 17, and many already have kids. The women earn up to 400 Euro per night.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Most girls come from rural areas of Romania, from broken families,&rdquo; says Carmen, &nbsp;&ldquo;Lots of them grew up in an orphanage, or they lived through a history of violence with parents, but a few were raised in a well-structured family or went to a high school.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In Italy, prostitution is tolerated, but exploitation is punished.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The pimps are Romanian, Albanian and Bulgarian. But most of the time they stick to their own nationality for prostitutes. They &lsquo;buy&rsquo; a part of the street and fill them with girls.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The men target women with financial problems, who are lonely or without parents, or those with mental issues. In many cases, they promise them a place to work as a domestic or in a shop.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;I met people who told me &lsquo;My cousin, my brother or my brother in law brought me here&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Carmen. &ldquo;Normally you would have faith, when your brother tells you &lsquo;Come to Italy and you will find work as a babysitter.&rsquo; After two weeks, she wakes up when he tells her: &lsquo;we haven&rsquo;t found work, because the employer has found someone else&rsquo;.&rdquo; Then he takes the girl to the streets.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Others say clearly: come to prostitute, because you will make good money. But they never imagined that life on the street would be so bad. They thought it would be a game where they make love with one man and then&nbsp;another.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the 00s, Romanian prostitutes in Italy suffered gang rape, cigarette burns to the arms, and were regularly beaten up - but now they don't put up with this kind of treatment, says Vittoria Quondamatteo, a psychologist from Rome-based NGO &ldquo;Il fiore del deserto&rdquo;, who works with Romanian trafficking victims.</p><div>While Romanians have a heavy presence on the streets in Naples, around 60 per cent of prostitutes in Rome are from Romania, according to social co-operative Parsec.</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;But girls don&rsquo;t want to work for small amounts of money, they want to earn what an Italian works in a day,&rdquo; adds Quondamatteo. &ldquo;They need the latest smartphone and Ipad and, if they don't have it, they must have it at any cost. So we move from forced prostitution to a choice of a career, where women offer a blow job for 50 Euro.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Naples: a violent and beautiful mess\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/IMG_1730.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 400px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Parents &ldquo;sell&rdquo; their kids to the streets</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Over the last decade, Carmen has seen parents selling their kids on the street, and cases of small children - as young as five - for sale for sex. She gives an example of an 11 year-old boy, pimped by his parents.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The police caught the boy with a &lsquo;client&rsquo;. The child did not speak Romanian well and his parents were confused about why what happened between the kid and the abuser was a crime.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The child told the police officers:</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Until now, I didn&rsquo;t do anything to the client - he gave me ten Euro to pee on him.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Prostitutes often deny their parents are involved in any way with their work, says Vittoria Quondamatteo.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;It is very difficult to work on this level there is an idealization of these parental figures, and they deny it: &lsquo;my father did not know, my mother did not know, he was a family friend, but my parents did not know&rsquo; and sometimes, even sadder, children are accustomed to violence within the family and so violence is the only form of love they know.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Here she has a theory:&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"Romanians who have been under such a strict regime [of Communism] have this inhibition of thought, so they say &lsquo;it's like that and that's it&rsquo;,\\\" she argues. \\\"They have a strong ego and very little ability to get in touch with a deep emotional level.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Romanian boys &ldquo;dominate&rdquo; gay sex market</div><p>As we turn the car near to the Garibaldi station, we are looking for boys. But it is hard to detect them. They do not dress provocatively. They dress just like boys. Jeans. Shorts. T-shirt. Or shirt. Trainers. Looking like they are on the town in search of girls. This is the style&nbsp;the male clients want.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Young Romanian men have been selling themselves in Naples since 2005. In most cases, they are having sex for a little bit of extra cash. They wash car windows in the day, meet an older man who makes a proposition, and take him up on the offer. A few are full-timers with their dedicated clients.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The majority are adults, 16-17 years old,&rdquo; says Carmen. &ldquo;At 17 they are married and already have children. Many times they work in a couple: the man prostitutes on one street and his wife on another.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A decade ago, the Romanian male prostitutes would not let themselves be penetrated by the client. Their refusal became so common, that a catchphrase became a kind of joke among clients in Rome and Naples - faccio solo l'attivo - &lsquo;I only do active&rsquo;. It was a way of the boys making themselves feel as though they were not gay.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But this has changed.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Because the temptation is high,&rdquo; says Carmen. &ldquo;If you meet a person who has more extravagant pleasures, they will want boys to be passive - and they will pay more. For example, a sex act between men costs a minimum of 50 Euro. A girl makes 20. Men make more, because a girl, in an evening, can have ten clients. For a boy it&rsquo;s tough to have ten assignations.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In special cases, with male prostitution, the clients will pay 200 to 300 Euro for unprotected sex. Between men, this is also mixed&nbsp;with the consumption of illegal substances. There are clients&nbsp;who pay Romanian boys only to have someone with whom to take drugs.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The Romanian Roma males are deeply involved in prostitution,&rdquo; says Andrea Morniroli, executive board member at Dedalus. &ldquo;However, since there is also a strong anti-gay stigma, young men tend not to go to health services, for fear of being discovered as prostitutes within their community.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"We didn't know how to to convince them to go, so we worked on their wives. Without saying that their husbands were prostitutes, we told the women that some sexually transmitted diseases might affect their child. That's how the wives pulled their husbands by the ears to the doctor.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Around 200 male prostitutes in Naples are from Romania, which is more than half of the male prostitutes in the city.

I mock them and tell them &lsquo;oh well. at the end of the day, you're like a man in his 50s who loses his head over a young girl&rsquo;.

Their presence at the club&nbsp;exists only on paper, not on the field.</p><p>From May 2015, FIFA banned the practice of third-party ownership - where a party independent of the player and his club held the &lsquo;economic rights&rsquo; to the player.&nbsp;</p><p>This allowed the owner to exercise influence over the player&rsquo;s future and his club&rsquo;s decision on whether to transfer or keep the player.</p><p>Usually an investment fund or a dedicated company undertakes third-party ownership.</p><p>But in the case of Apollon Limassol, it appears a football club has taken on the role of third-party owner.</p><p>This is backed up by the evidence on player contracts revealed by Football Leaks.</p><p>We have identified seven players from Serbia and Romania - Mijat Gacinovic, <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=86&amp;idC=96&amp;idRec=1273&amp;recType=story\\\">Andrija Zivkovic</a>, Nikola Maksimovic, Nikola Aksentijevic, Marko Pavlovski, Luka Jovic and Cristian Manea - who were signed or part-bought by Apollon Limassol, often away from public scrutiny.</p><p>But they never played for the team.

He is also a fan of the team.</p><p>This news comes at a time when the players' union FifPro issued a <a href=\\\"https://www.fifpro.org/news/first-global-employment-report-unveiled/en\\\">report </a>revealing that 29 per cent of football players who moved for a transfer fee said they were either put under pressure to join another club or did not end up in the team they wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>This also risks Apollon Limassol being called out by FIFA as a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; club - a destination club where a player never takes to the field, but&nbsp;which acts as a 'conduit' between two other clubs.

They beat France 1-0 in the final. That summer night in Marijampole, Lithuania, midfielder Marko Pavlovski had the honour to be the first to raise the trophy above his head.&nbsp;</p><p>He was the captain of Serbia, a creative midfielder who grew up at the OFK Beograd academy from the age of eight. A few days after the final, his club president told the media in Belgrade that no player at OFK is represented by an agent.&nbsp;</p><p>The president was none other than Zvezdan Terzic, now president of Red Star Belgrade and brother-in-law of Ramadani&rsquo;s lieutenant Nikola Damjanac.&nbsp;</p><p>You probably remember him. He&rsquo;s the football official who had one million Euro in spare change to make bail from prison.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of that month and away from the public knowledge, Pavlovski was already an Apollon Limassol player. As in the previous cases, the player signed a ghostly four year contract.</p><p>The guys that pulled the strings at Apollon were clearly in a hurry. They didn&rsquo;t even bother that the player&rsquo;s name was misspelled &ldquo;Pavolski&rdquo; instead of Pavlovski every time they mentioned it in the contract.&nbsp;</p><p>This was 28 August 2013. Two days later, Pavlovski moved to FC Porto on loan for the 2013/2014 season.</p><p>Before a spell at OFK Belgrade and his current club RNK Split in Croatia, Pavlovski went to Belgian club Royal Excel Mouscron in 2015.</p><p>This is a club where superagent Pini Zahavi holds influence - he bought the club for a short time through an investment fund in 2015, and his close relatives are on the board. Players often move back and forth between Mouscron and Apollon. <em>More on <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=86&amp;idC=96&amp;idRec=1271&amp;recType=story\\\">Pavlovski here</a>.</em></p><p>The U-19 European champion is among the first players Zahavi moved between what appear to be &ldquo;bridge clubs&rdquo;.</p><p>One month after Pavlovski arrived in Mouscron, he was followed by Romanian defender Cristian Manea, now 19 years old. Manea was playing for Viitorul Constanta, a Romanian club owned by Gheorghe Hagi, the Romanian midfield legend who played for both Real Madrid and Barcelona during the 90s. The boy had learned his craft at the player's namesake 'Academia Hagi', a training company for young players.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, according to the official Royal Excel Mouscron (then Peruwelz) website at the time, Manea was on loan from Chelsea. Early that summer, the Romanian and British media announced Manea&rsquo;s transfer to England from Academia Hagi. The news was fed and encouraged by Academia Hagi officials.&nbsp;</p><p>In reality, Manea had already been transferred to Apollon Limassol one year earlier for 2.5 million Euro. One million Euro from Manea&rsquo; s transfer fee went to a Maltese offshore company, Dito Trading, <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1252&amp;recType=story\\\">listed at the same address as Lian Sports</a>.</p><p>He has never been to the football ground. He never had a medical there or trained with them.<br>&ldquo;Cristi has never been to Cyprus,&rdquo; a family member told us.</p><p>Apollon is also branching out to capture players from the USA. Take this example. On 24 June 2015, Amadeu Paixao, director of sports management company Principal Sports Management is solicited by Tom Markham, a friend of the sporting director of American team Colorado Rapids, to buy the economic rights of a player. This comes after the FIFA ban on TPO came into effect on 1 May 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>The player in question is the Ireland-born US international Shane O&rsquo;Neill, now 23 years old.</p><p>&ldquo;The Colorado Rapids are interested in selling [Shane O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s] economic rights as they need money to invest in the rest of their squad. Would he be of interest&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>O&rsquo;Neill was sold on 7 August to Apollon Limassol for an undisclosed amount. He made no appearance for them. He signed for Royal Excel Mouscron (as the club is now known) on 31 August 2015. He made no appearance for them.&nbsp;</p><p>On 16 February, he was loaned out again to Cambridge United, made two appearances, and came back to Apollon Limassol, before going on to Dutch club NAC Brega, where he is playing.&nbsp;</p><p>Never once did he ever play a match for Apollon - and the Dutch club would not respond to questions as to whether he had ever been to Cyprus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><img alt=\\\"Aksentijevic: secretly signed a four-year contract with Apollon Limassol\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/OFK%20Beograd%20-%20Vojvodina%20Aksentijevic.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 477px;\\\"></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><br>Fifth case: Nikola Aksentijevic - the 48-hour player&nbsp;</div><p>For a seven-year period ending in 2014, the Partizan president was Dragan Djuric, who is now being investigated in Serbia for his management at the club.

So many that local Cypriots have dubbed Limassol \\\"The Russian City\\\".&nbsp;</p><p>Founded in 1954, Apollon Limassol has won its national championship three times (1991, 1994, 2006). Since 2012, the president of Apollon Football (Public) Limited - the company that administrates the club - is former football and basketball agent Nikos Kirzis. The 41 year-old was born into the the wealthy family of the former Apollon president Dimi Kirzis.</p><p>Meanwhile the President of Cyprus, Nikos Anastasiades, is a keen Apollon fan and is seen as a kind of protector for the club. To acknowledge this, in June 2015, Nikos Kirzis publicly thanked him for &ldquo;his efforts regarding the construction of the new football stadium&rdquo; that will be ready by 2019.</p><p>Another former board member of the club (1972-1977) is the controversial UEFA treasurer and FIFA ExCo member Marios Lefkaritis.

After winning the FA cup in 2008, Portsmouth's fate began to nosedive. Now the great club languishes in the fourth tier of the English league.

It is very effective, but he is not one of the agents who are great connoisseurs of football. Do not ask him if Cristiano Ronaldo is right-handed or left-handed, it does not interest him. On the other hand, he knows the market value of a player and knows how much a young player can bring him.\\\"</p><p>Controversy goes hand-in-hand with this agent born in the Macedonian town of Tetovo. In 2003, his name appeared during an investigation made by German prosecutors against the Albanian brothers Burim and Bashkim Osmani.&nbsp;</p><p>Linked to organised crime in Hamburg, the Osmani clan took unsecured loans of over 70 million Euro from Volksbank Lauenburg in Germany. They used a part of the money in a controversial residential project in Skopje, Macedonia, nicknamed the 'Chinese Wall'. Ramadani himself took a one million Euro loan from the same bank despite he and his wife, Sabine, providing a yearly income proof for only 35,000 Euro.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Macedonian media, Ramadani and the Osmani brothers were the &ldquo;German investors&rdquo; behind a company named Lian LBO Engineering LLC that became embroiled in a scandal in Skopje following erection of a grandiose residential building on the green site of the city&rsquo;s Gradski Park.&nbsp;</p><p>The piece of land was initially bought from the authorities by Vardar Skopje boss, Borce Riseski, at a cheap price with the declared intention of building a parking garage for the sporting club. Overnight, the garage became a five storey hotel and Riseski sold 20 per cent of it to Ramadani&rsquo;s Lian LBO motivating a lack of funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Journalists in Macedonia wrote about a minister receiving death threats amidst public pressure to demolish the building.&nbsp;</p><p>Ramadani was questioned by prosecutors and he denied that he pressured or bribed state officials to receive construction approval. The case ended with his business partner Riseski being convicted for one year along with a City official. The construction stopped, the investors had to demolish the top floor and the attic then sold the apartments. Ramadani reportedly received 25 million Euro from selling his part in the still standing Chinese Wall to German businessman Siegfried Greve.</p><p>The building is now a luxury facility owned by the wealthy businessman Enver Maliqi.&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><br>Tell me about this club Royal Excel Mouscron - that was called something else last year</div><p>Apollon Limassol has an ongoing relationship of player-transfer with Royal Excel Mouscron, a Belgian club in the country&rsquo;s first division that until this year was known as Royal Mouscron Peruwelz.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently three Apollon players are on loan to Mouscron - Valentin Viola, Luka Stojanovic and Cristian Manea.</p><p>Mouscron is a club where Zahavi retains a massive influence.&nbsp;</p><p>In the summer of 2015, after half a decade in financial limbo, the&nbsp;club was bailed out by a Maltese company called Gol Football Malta Limited for 8.5 million Euro, connected to Pini Zahavi.

Turkey&rsquo;s pre-eminent seaside resort. A 450-foot yacht moored on the Mediterranean shore. The Savarona. This mega-vessel had an impeccable reputation. Reputedly named after an African swan, it was built in the Hamburg shipyard for a wealthy American grand-daughter of John August Roebling, the constructor of the Brooklyn Bridge. In 1929, the family aimed to spend its riches building the world's &ldquo;biggest ever yacht&rdquo;.</p><p>Taking to the waves in 1931, the boat starred in a 1934 German sci-fi flick 'Gold' about alchemists turning metals to gold using an underwater reactor.</p><p>But the yacht never reached the USA due to high import taxes.</p><p>In 1938 it ended up as a gift from the Turkish Government to their President Kemal Ataturk, an old soldier who raised Turkey from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire and created a modern secular European state.</p><p>Ataturk did not enjoy strolling across the deck and admiring the view over a highball glass of raki for long - he died of cirrhosis of the liver that November.</p><p>The ship languished in port for decades until 1989, until a wealthy local businessman Kahraman Sad&#305;ko&#287;lu leased the vessel from the Turkish Government. With an eye on rich tourists and local oligarchs, he invested almost 50 million USD in its restoration and hired the vessel out for parties - for around 30,000 dollars per night.</p><p>But on the morning of 28 September 2010, the yacht returned to celebrity for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>A Turkish military helicopter lands on the boat.

Its Sports Management division went on to represent the image rights of global stars Neymar, Usain Bolt and David Beckham.</p><p>The tenant of the yacht is Kazakh-based billionaire and Belgian&nbsp;citizen Alexander Mashkevitch, the president of metal and mining empire Eurasian National Resources Corporation (ENRC) and a personal friend of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev.</p><p>Mashkevitch rented the boat for eight days through one of Arif&rsquo;s associates for 309,000 USD. He has allegedly hired the boat every year for the past five. Turkish Prosecutor Yusuf Hakki Dogan says the boat was used twice for sexscapades - in September and in June that year.</p><p>Among the other guests are Mashkevitch&rsquo;s colleagues at ENRC, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov, seven security staff, two masseurs and two other women, according to the Bill of Indictment to the criminal court of Antalya City.</p><p>Reported to be on the boat is Kanat Saudabayev, a secretary of state in the Government of Kazakhstan. According to Vatan, a Turkish newspaper, reprinting info from Russian news wire Regnum, Saudabayev &ldquo;escaped from prison thanks to frantic diplomatic contacts between Ankara and Astana&rdquo;.</p><p>But the police reports do not include the Kazakh top brass. Nor do the oligarchs suffer arrest. Only Tevfik, his entourage and the girls are detained.</p><p>Why? Because a gang of some of the wealthiest and most influential businessmen from Kazakhstan, with connections to the leaders of Turkey and&nbsp;Russia, are accused of desecrating the yacht of the &lsquo;The Father of the Turks&rsquo; by using its cabins to pay for sex with Russian teenagers.</p><p>For now, Tevfik is taking the hit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Olga, client wants sex&rdquo;</div><div><p>The police sting began earlier in the year. March. At the Rixos Premium Hotel in Belek, Turkey, 50 kilometres from Antalya. The five star hotel boasts a kilometre of sandy beaches, 640 rooms and 40 villas. This is part of the chain of the Rixos Hotels, in which the Arif family enjoyed a major stake.</p><p>The year before Arif was still head of a US real estate group, Bayrock, which boasted that it had developed seven luxury waterfront resorts on the Mediterranean, including the Rixos Hotel Belek. Its other projects included the Trump SoHo - and its strategic partner was Trump.</p><p>In early 2010, the cops received information that two men, Musa &Ccedil;elik and Gunduz Akdeniz, were involved in providing underage prostitutes to rich clients of fancy hotels, according to a bill of indictment. The cops bugged their phones and discovered they were financed by Tevfik Arif.</p><p>The group had a secret lexicon. Gunduz was 'The Uncle' and Tevfik &lsquo;The Boss&rsquo;. &lsquo;Models&rsquo; were the girls. The main accusation: from modelling agencies in Russia, they were trafficking girls as young as 15 years in age. 'The Uncle&rsquo; would call on &Ccedil;elik to use his connections to supply teenagers&nbsp;from Russia. Proof that Celik was involved in such procurement is detailed in the police report.</p><p>On 20 February 2010, Musa Chelik negotiates with an &lsquo;agent&rsquo; for women from eastern Europe called Olga via SMS. She asks him: &ldquo;Do you want all models for sex? I should know it because many don&rsquo;t agree for sex.&rdquo;</p><p>Musa replies in his message:</p><p>&ldquo;Olga, client wants sex&rdquo;</p><p>The gang is looking for beautiful and compliant girls who know foreign languages. Musa creates a website where photos are published, so clients can pick and choose their preference. In particular, the gang are looking for girls aged 16 - or even younger. The legal age of consent in Turkey is 18. This is child abuse.</p><p>On 4 March 2010, Gunduz asks &Ccedil;elik about a girl called Vasilisa &ldquo;the one who is 15&rdquo; and asks if her friends will also come from Russia to Turkey. The next day, Gunduz tells him that The Boss &ldquo;demands more photos of better looking girls&rdquo;.</p><p>On 12 March 2010, the gang is willing to raise the price of girls from 1,000 to 1,500 USD since the girls are 16, Gunduz tells &Ccedil;elik.</p><p>On 15 March, the Turkish cops stop a black 2005 Mercedes Vito at 8 pm on the suburbs of Belek. Tevfik Arif&rsquo;s driver Kemal Tokay is taking foreign girls to the Rixos. The teenagers&nbsp;in the car include a 15 year-old girl called Vasilisa and&nbsp;a 16 year-old German named Stefania, as well as&nbsp;three young Russian women.</p><p>On 16 March, the receptionist at the hotel requires personal info about the girls and Celik says they are guests of &lsquo;the Uncle&rsquo; Gunduz. The girls do not check into the hotel, but they are recorded on security cameras and walking through the corridors. One girl - Olesya - has moles on her face that were not visible in her photograph and she has dyed her hair. Gunduz tells &Ccedil;elik: &ldquo;we will send that unpretty back, the plane is taking off at half past one&rdquo;. Olesya is put on a flight back to Russia.</p><p>During this time, Tevfik Arif stays at the Rixos Premium Hotel.</p><p>But at this stage, the police do not raid the hotel. They are collecting more evidence.</p><p>'Uncle' Gunduz tells Tevfik that his phone is tapped and &ldquo;all names and other information has been obtained.&rdquo; Akdeniz explains that the tapping was going on for &ldquo;about a year or two already.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;2-3 days ago Fettah Bey came to Istanbul and talked to Vakif Bey, told man-to-man.&rdquo;</p><p>Fettah Bey could have been&nbsp;a reference to Fettah Tamince, owner of the Rixos Hotel group, but the multi-millionaire hotel boss denied to The Black Sea that he had ever communicated with Gunduz Akdeniz.</p><p>The gang switches its strategy.</p><p>But this obvious threat does not stop them procuring Russian girls.</p><p>Instead it only seeks to hire and transport young women over 18 - a practice which still counts as trafficking under Turkish law.</p><p>On 25 September, ten girls fly from Russia to Istanbul. They drive to seaside resort Bodrum, where they stay at another Rixos Hotel. Arif's driver then takes them to the Savarona. The next day, Tevfik is critiquing the women. He does not like one of the girls - Ekaterina - and dispatches her back to Moscow.</p><p>The party is organised by Mashkevitch, who has invited his colleagues Chodiev and Ibragimov. The brains of the operation is&nbsp;Ibragimov, Mashkevitch is the boss, and Chodiev is the schemer, according to a former employee of the trio.</p><p>Meanwhile Tevfik was &ldquo;a straw man&rdquo; according to the former employee - a &ldquo;handyman&rdquo; for others, who does not have a brilliant business mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Mashkevitch organised it and wanted [the party],&rdquo; says the former employee. &ldquo;Tevfik had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p><p>The Kazakh trio did&nbsp;not respond to questions from European Investigative Collaborations.</p><p>After the raid, the police photograph and film the girls. Their bodies splashed across the Turkish and international media. Six men are under put under arrest. The owner of the nearby luxury hotel Mardan Palace, Telman Ishmailov, arrives at the courthouse during the interrogation of the suspects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Jenny from the eastern bloc</div><p>Azeri-born Ishmailov later bought football club Beitar Jerusalem and is famous for paying celebrities tonnes of cash to come to his parties, allegedly giving Jennifer Lopez 1.4 million dollars to sing him 'Baby, I love You' on his birthday.</p><p>The sorry incident is here on <a href=\\\"http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TCPRIk_A7M\\\">Youtube</a>, where Ismailov cuddles&nbsp;the actress-singer&nbsp;and forces a jewel-encrusted watch onto her wrist.</p><p>After the yacht incident, Ishmailov uses the entrance reserved for judges and prosecutors to meet with Arif and the two spend ten minutes talking, it was reported. After he leaves, his bodyguards attack journalists and cameramen filming the oligarch.</p><p>Meanwhile the rich male 'clients' disappear. Saudabayev allegedly uses his diplomatic immunity to evade arrest, while Mashkevitch is whisked out of Turkey by a senior contact in a major Turkish political party, according to a source.</p><p>This leaves the nine Russian girls in the hands of the Turkish police.</p><p>On 30 September, the handler for the girls - a woman called Ilona - texts the Russians telling &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bear any witness - none of you!&rdquo;</p><p>But there is confidence that this scandal will not escalate, and that the authorities will not succeed in their prosecution. From the same phone number comes another message to the girls: &ldquo;keep silent, sign nothing, they are beyond control and have no power, you&rsquo;ll come back home soon&rdquo;.</p><p>The girls refuse contact with their relatives, lawyers or the Russian consulate. And they will not testify.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;The beautiful women sit at the table and decorate it - like flowers&rdquo;</div><div><p>Following his arrest, Tevfik denies involvement in prostitution or human trafficking. He says the women were invited as guests of the businessmen. He sticks to his story that they were &lsquo;models&rsquo; and that he was providing a chauffeur service to them.</p><p>&ldquo;As they don&rsquo;t know Turkey,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we help models to travel around the country.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile Tevfik&rsquo;s associate Gunduz Akdeniz argues that the women only had an ornamental role. He says the girls were &ldquo;for companionship at lunch, dinner and on walks&rdquo;. When Tevfik holds meetings with businessmen about investments, Gunduz says his boss &ldquo;would bring beautiful women and seat them at the table to decorate it, like flowers.&rdquo;</p><p>The police report accuses Arif of paying money to women, agencies and intermediaries, who help supply him with prostitutes. This is not for himself - but for friends and business colleagues.</p><p>In the trial, the prosecutor accuses Tevfik and his entourage of engaging girls under 18 in prostitution and trafficking them to Turkey. So this accusation is more severe.&nbsp;</p><p>In court, Tevfik hits back at the accusations, stating that he was just out on a boat with some friends. &ldquo;One of my friends came with his wife,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;One of them came with his girlfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>But the gang is then pushed on the incident from March at the Rixos Hotel Belek - where the girls were underage. Under questioning, &Ccedil;elik states: &ldquo;In March of 2010 I brought in very young girls. They were 16 or 17. I brought them in at Tevfik Arif&rsquo;s request. To be precise, Gunduz Akdeniz phoned me with that request.&rdquo;</p><p>Those making these requests deny their involvement. Despite staying at the hotel at the same time as the girls, Tevfik says he never saw them. Gunduz adds: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know whether underage girls came to us. I just look at the photographs and pick them.&rdquo;</p><p>The case is looking for a victim. But the girls themselves will not furnish the prosecutors with further evidence.</p><p>The Turkish Embassy in Moscow turns over a statement from Vasilisa - who was 15 at the time she came to Turkey. She has been questioned by the local police in Russia. This is the text:</p><p>&ldquo;In March 2010, I was invited to the opening show of a big store in Antalya, then I went to Antalya by plane, I settled in a hotel, but when the fashion show was cancelled, I decided to make a holiday in Antalya for a while, I went to a hotel in the city centre, I stayed there for two nights together with my friend Ksenia and we returned back to Moscow they thought me and my friend, we were prostitutes, there was no illegal act against us, their consideration of me as prostitute is a great aspersion made against me.&rdquo;</p><p>Nor is there any assistance from the alleged victim Stefania. Under questioning, she makes exactly the same statement as the one above, word for word.</p><p>On 11 April 2011, the court acquits Arif. But Musa Celik and Gunduz Akdeniz, plus two others are punished for two years in prison for &ldquo;mediation in prostitution, finding a place and inducing to prostitution.&rdquo;</p><p>Eventually this sentence was postponed and Celik and Akdeniz are released with a fine. However the case has been ping-ponging around the Turkish courts for the last five years. Currently, Arif's acquittal has been upheld, and he remains at liberty, while Celik and Akdeniz could still face jail time.</p><p>The case is under investigation by the Supreme Court of Appeals. The lawyer for Gunduz Akdeniz, Birol Ciftcibasi, is not expecting an answer until October 2017.</p><p>&ldquo;This case shouldn&rsquo;t have been opened from the beginning because there is no crime that they can prove,&rdquo; says Ciftcibasi. &ldquo;The only evidence they showed was a camera recording showing a condom. This cannot be sufficient evidence.&rdquo;</p><p>If there was a crime as established by the court then Tevfik Arif should have been re-tried as well, say legal experts.</p><p>&ldquo;The&nbsp;target people went free at the end,&rdquo; says Ciftcibasi. &ldquo;The rich ones went free.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Who was on the boat?</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div></div><p><img alt=\\\"Bazhaev, Machkevitch and Tevfik Arif celebrating: all three were reported to be on the Savarona (the picture is not on the boat)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Tevfik%20Arif%20(orange%2C%20on%20right%20with%20pink%20tie).jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 700px; height: 465px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">The Money Man: Alexander Mashkevitch</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div><strong>THE MOGUL&nbsp;</strong>The Kyrgyzstan-born Mashkevitch, now 62, made billions from privatized chromium, alumina and gas operations in Kazakhstan following the collapse of the Soviet Union.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Together with his partners, a Kyrgyz - Alijan Ibragimov - and an Uzbekh - Patokh Chodiev, he formed the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2007.</div><div><p>Named the Kazakh 'Trio', although none are from Kazakhstan - they have reportedly been the largest investors in Kazakhstan since the fall of the USSR.</p><p>Mashkevitch is a philanthropist who has financed the construction of mosques, synagogues and an Orthodox Church in Kazakshtan, and he was vice-president of the European Union of Jewish Communities from 2002 to 2011.</p><p>The oligarch was also a&nbsp;strategic partner&nbsp;in American real estate projects with Tevfik Arif's Bayrock company and President-elect of the USA Donald Trump.</p><p>All three members of the trio were on the Savarona, according to the Bill of Indictment, alongside Chodiev's assistant Alexander Tsert.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" id=\\\"donald_trump_s_paltevfik_arif\\\">Donald Trump's pal: Tevfik Arif</div><div><p><strong>THE FIXER</strong>&nbsp;Tevfik Arif is a Kazakh-born businessman, with links to the Turkish chain Rixos Hotels, the giant building firm Sembol Construction and Bayrock.</p><p>In 2001, Arif co-founded real estate group Bayrock, where he operated out of a Fifth Avenue office in Trump Tower,&nbsp;along with Felix Sater, a convicted felon who enjoyed Government protection for informing on the mob for the FBI.</p><p>In 2004, the Bayrock Group began receiving what in total would become ten million Euro in equity contributions.

Meanwhile the two major Bayrock developments - the Trump SoHo in New York and Trump Fort Lauderdale in Florida - ended in foreclosure.</p><p>In the late 1990s, former economist in the&nbsp;<span style=\\\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\\\">USSR Ministry of Commerce and Trade-turned businessman&nbsp;</span>Tevfik Arif moved between Turkey and the USA, using his access to vast amounts of cash to invest in the New York real estate market.</p><p>Tevfik himself was also a developer of the luxury Rixos hotel chains in Turkey and his family had acquired the Aktyubinsk Chromium Chemicals Plant (ACCP) in Aktobe, Kazakhstan. The plant is the only producer of chromium-based chemical products in the country and, according to a 2002 NATO Science Committee report, is responsible for pouring toxins into the local water supply, rendering it undrinkable.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1996, Arif started out&nbsp;his American adventure with the purchase and redevelopment of a waterfront shopping center in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn - in the centre of the borough's Russian community. This was followed by three more condominium projects nearby.</p><p>Arif went on to found Bayrock in 2001. This was to grow massively in the years leading up to the crash of 2008. In half a decade, the company stated that, through its affiliated entities, it had made investments in transactions comprising real estate assets valued in excess of 2.5 billion USD.</p><p>Bayrock wanted to enter the top echelons of the US property boom and expand into the dynamic Russian real estate sector. But it needed a big name to lend the company weight. It also craved for a strong brand for major projects in Arif's speciality - the hotel sector. The firm had the equity, but lacked the namecheck. The top individual who could help with this expansion was Donald Trump.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Boys in the Bubble</div><p>American real estate was booming in the early 2000s. Bayrock already had an office in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, where Arif operated with a convicted felon, Felix Sater. In 1991, Sater was a broker at Bear Stearns when he entered into an argument&nbsp;&ldquo;over a girl&rdquo; with another broker, which ended with Sater smashing a Margherita&nbsp;glass&nbsp;and plunging the stem into the face of the other man.</p><p>He was convicted to jail for a year <a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/nyregion/17trump.html\\\">in 1993.</a> But he was to keen to put this - and other offences - behind him and remake himself as a property magnate.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Bayrock's campaign literature boasted that it has a strategic partnerships with the &ldquo;most prestigious firms worldwide&rdquo;. Top of the list is The Trump Organisation - next to a huge photo of Tevfik Arif and Donald Trump.</p><p>The financing for Bayrock came from strategic partners such as the Icelandic investment fund the FL Group, which allegedly came with backing from companies from the ex-USSR, and entrepreneur Alexander Mashkevitch, according to a presentation document.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/source%20iof%20financing.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 400px; height: 277px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The company bragged that Mashkevitch controlled five billion USD in estimated sales through his Eurasia Group, a Kazakhstan-based company with interests in aluminum, chromium, coal, <a href=\\\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3117892/Bayrock-Presentation.pdf\\\">construction and banking</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The company boasted&nbsp;that it developed seven luxury waterfront resorts on the Mediterranean Sea. These properties included the Rixos Hotel in Belek, Turkey - an assemblage of villas, luxury suites and a golf course. At this luxury resort in 2010, Arif was suspected of ordering his staff to solicit underage &ldquo;models&rdquo; <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1274&amp;recType=story\\\">as young as 15 from Russia</a>.</p><p>Later that year, this police sting operation also caught Tevfik Arif and Alexander Mashkevitch on board a luxury yacht moored at Antalya, Turkey with business friends and nine Russian &ldquo;models&rdquo; - some of whom were teenagers. Mashkevitch never faced trial, and Arif was later acquitted, but members of his entourage still face possible further sentencing.</p><p>But Bayrock was not a transparent venture. A 2010 complaint filed to a court in New Jersey claimed: &ldquo;Arif, Satter [sic], and [Bayrock executive Julius] Schwarz operated [Bayrock] for years through a pattern of continuous, related crimes, including mail, wire, and bank fraud; tax evasion; money laundering; conspiracy; bribery; extortion; and embezzlement.&rdquo;</p><p>After his conviction for assault, Sater was involved in a stock fraud. But he enjoyed Government protection for informing on the mob for the FBI. This meant he could conceal his criminal past when soliciting bank loans for his projects.</p><p>But in 2004, the Bayrock Group began receiving what would become ten million Euro in equity contributions. In the 2010 complaint cited&nbsp;above, a confidential informant told the plaintiffs that this money came from Arif's brother in Russia, &ldquo;who had access to cash accounts at a chromium refinery in Kazakhstan&rdquo;.</p><p>Tevfik's brother, Refik, was the one who built up a massive business from the sale of chrome-based chemicals in Kazakhstan at the ACCP factory, criticised by the NATO report.&nbsp;The industrial chemicals were sold to top western brands such as Procter &amp; Gamble and BASF.</p><p>The complaint alleges that Bayrock Holdings LLC is a &ldquo;mere conduit hiding that source&ldquo;.</p><p>Later Refik Arif financed a company overseen by his nephew Arif Arif (who is Tevfik's son), Doyen Sports. This<a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1277&amp;recType=story\\\"> London-headquartered management firm</a> develops the commercial and image rights of sportsmen such as David Beckham, Boris Becker, Usain Bolt and Neymar Jr.</p><p>But Football Leaks has revealed the constellation of firms in the Doyen universe feature shell companies in Malta and the United Arab Emirates, vast secret commissions to assist with player transfers, false billing and backdated contracts signed by frontmen. <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1276&amp;recType=story\\\">One example is here.</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Money would \\\"magically\\\" show up</div><p>For two years, whenever Bayrock ran out of cash, the holding company would &ldquo;magically show up with a wire from 'somewhere' just large enough to keep the company going&rdquo; adds the complaint. Without this cash from Kazakhstan, Bayrock &ldquo;could not have turned the lights on&rdquo;.</p><p>In 2005, while Bayrock was receiving mysterious money, Arif and Donald Trump began working on projects together.</p><p>The masterpiece was to become the 46-floor apartment complex - Trump SoHo - where&nbsp;each unit cost over a million dollars to build.</p><p>Arif told magazine <a href=\\\"http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Arif+brings+lap+of+luxury+to+New+York+City+market.-a0169460385\\\">Real Estate Weekly</a> that success stems from surrounding yourself with the right people, which included Donald Trump.</p><p>&ldquo;He's been very helpful to us from the beginning and he's been very helpful in opening some doors. The strength of the relationship is: we do what we do best &ndash; and we're very active in what we do &ndash; and Trump does what he does best,&rdquo; Arif said.&nbsp;</p><p>Arif&rsquo;s ambition in 2007 was to bring the luxury of Manhattan to the less illustrious NYC boroughs. &ldquo;As Kennedy said, 'Some men see things as they are and say why? I dream things that never were and say why not?'&rdquo; Arif told the magazine.</p><p>With Trump, Bayrock was now helping to develop the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, Ft. Lauderdale and Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower Phoenix. But the ambitions did not stop at the borders of the USA.</p><p>Trump and Arif had grand plans. They aimed to expand the Trump brand to Moscow, Istanbul, Kiev and Warsaw - possibly even the Crimean resort of Yalta. Deals which Trump called &ldquo;phenomenal&rdquo;. Arif was going to open the doors for Trump's east European invasion, and give Trump up to 25 per cent interest, management fees and a potential percentage of gross income in the projects. Trump did not even need to put up cash. All he had to do was to lend out his name.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a package of deals that Mr. Arif was heading, that he was doing very well on,&ldquo; said Trump later, &ldquo;it was almost like mass production of a car.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"A residence, a condo, now a hotel: Trump SoHo under construction (Trump)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/SoHO%20UNDER%20CONSTRUCTION.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 500px; height: 750px;\\\"></p></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Disaster 1: Trump SoHo stumbles to foreclosure</div><div><p>New York City's Trump SoHo, which is actually just west of SoHo, was planned to be an apartment block. But zoning restrictions and a fierce battle from local campaigners such as the SoHo Alliance, forced him to transform it into a condominium hotel, where buyers stay for part of the year and rent their apartments for the remainder.</p><p>Arif and Trump's partners in the project were Tamir Sapir (Temur Sepiashvili from Georgia, now deceased) and his son Alex Sapir, whose Sapir Organization has owned millions of square feet in Manhattan.</p><p>&ldquo;Tom [Tamir] and Alex came to us with a complete proposal. We looked at it, and we loved it,&rdquo; Trump said at the time. While the Sapir organisation owned the majority of the property, Trump admitted to owning around 18 per cent, in <a href=\\\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2430267/trumps-lawsuit-on-net-worth.pdf\\\">a 2007 deposition</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;After many years of work with The Trump Organization on various projects, we are delighted to be delivering the Trump standard of luxury and lifestyle to SoHo,&rdquo; stated<a href=\\\"https://www.hitpages.com/doc/5903492946329600/1#pageTop\\\"> Tevfik Arif</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The President-Elect was not shy to advertise this property - even though the source of cash for Bayrock was mysterious. A magazine advertisement featured Trump&rsquo;s daughter Ivanka in a cocktail dress, under the tagline 'Possess Your Own Soho'. An advert for the property was broadcast in the finale of Trump's reality TV show 'The Apprentice' in 2006.</p><p>The construction of Trump SoHo saw controversies. The bones of possible 19th-century slaves were discovered at the site, where an African Methodist Episcopal church had stood until 1963.</p><p>On 14 January 2008 A Ukrainian worker on the 44th floor of the site, Yuriy Vanchytskyy, was preparing to pour concrete into a wooden mold that doubled-up as a floor, when the mold collapsed. Cement and work materials plunged down, together with Vanchytskyy and a second worker. The Ukrainian missed the safety net and fell 42 stories to the second floor - where a jutting piece of metal <a href=\\\"http://nymag.com/news/features/45591/index3.html\\\">decapitated him</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Bragging became the undoing of the project. In September 2007, Trump claimed the 400 units had received<a href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/magazine/14wwln-consumed-t.html\\\"> 3,200 applications</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;and his daughter Ivanka Trump told <a href=\\\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/trump-investors-dollar-idUKN26147420080626\\\">Reuters</a> in June 2008 that 60 per cent of the units were sold.&nbsp;</p><p>The Trump SoHo opened on 9 April 2010. A symbol of uber-gentrificiation for a bohemian zone.&nbsp;Soon buyers realised that only just over 15 per cent of the property was purchased.</p><p>On 2 August 2010, a group of these buyers filed litigation in the Manhattan Federal District Court against the project&rsquo;s developers, including Bayrock and Arif. They stated groups and individuals behind the project had <a href=\\\"http://therealdeal.com/2011/11/03/bayrock-group-and-sapir-organization-settle-federal-lawsuit-at-trump-soho-at-246-spring-street-give-buyers-refunds/\\\">inflated sales figures </a>in the first 18 months of marketing.&nbsp;</p><p>They wanted their contracts rescinded, their deposits returned and were seeking damages and fees.</p><p>Bayrock, Sapir, Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Jr. were under fire for &ldquo;an ongoing pattern of fraudulent misrepresentations and deceptive sales practices.&rdquo;</p><p>On 2 November 2011, ten of the buyers, including French footballer Oliver Dacourt, received a 90 per cent refund on their deposits following <a href=\\\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/05/26/inside-donald-trumps-empire-why-he-wont-run-for-president.htmlhttp://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/print-edition/2010/12/24/former-trump-hotel-in-fort-lauderdale.html\\\">this suit</a>.</p><p>By 2014, the developers&nbsp;had sold <a href=\\\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cim-group-to-take-control-of-new-yorks-trump-soho-hotel-condo-1416513457\\\">less than one-third</a> of the 391&nbsp;units. The property faced foreclosure.</p><p>Now it is a hotel that still uses the Trump name.</p><p>But the boom-time monolith is not beloved by the locals. Trump faced constant criticism from his neighbours at every stage of the project. In his 2008 book 'Never Give Up: How I Turned My Biggest Challenges into Success' he devoted a passage to the glass-and-steel giant, stating that: &ldquo;I can guarantee you that my SoHo neighbors are going to love it &ndash; eventually.&rdquo;</p><p>But Sean Sweeney, director of the campaign group SoHo Alliance, now tell us: &ldquo;It fits into the city like a big middle finger.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Disaster 2: Trump Moscow fails to take off</div><div><p>In 2007, Trump believed his deals with Bayrock were falling apart because of negative publicity from writer Timothy L. O'Brien and his book 'TrumpNation; the art of being Donald' and a sister article in the New York Times. The book claimed that Trump's net worth was 150 to 250 million USD, rather than the two to five billion USD, that Trump had boasted.</p><p>Trump brought a lawsuit against O'Brien, which was heard in December 2007. Trump claimed he lost seven deals as a result of the book which downgraded him from billionaire status and tarnished his global standing as a property genius.</p><p>He also believed&nbsp;he lost Bayrock's mega-Trump tower deal in Phoenix because of the book. &ldquo;I believe that without this book you probably would have had the zoning completed,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Plus, he&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;a project in Moscow with Tevfik Arif fell through because of the expose. For this deal, his closest associate was Tevfik.</p><p>&ldquo;I only dealt with Mr. Arif because Mr Arif had the contacts,&rdquo; Trump stated. &ldquo;He had international connections&hellip; Mr Arif really was involved in not only that deal but the other couple of deals we were talking about.&rdquo;</p><p>The idea was for a Trump International Tower and Hotel in Moscow, Kiev, Warsaw and Istanbul - and Arif gave Trump access to these deals. Bayrock knew the investors and Trump believes they were friends of Arif, although he could not remember at the time who they were.</p><p>Arif would usually call Trump or &ldquo;come up&rdquo; to see him in his big tower. Arif &ldquo;did bring people up from Russia&hellip; They were talking about a number of deals in Moscow.&rdquo;</p><p>Under the deals, Trump would have a 20 to 25 per cent ownership interest. He did not need to invest anything.</p><p>But then the new revelations came out from O'Brien.</p><p>The future President-Elect stated that Arif called him and said: &ldquo;the article was terrible, I think all those deals are dead.&rdquo;</p><p>It seemed the Russian investors wanted nothing to do with&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>In 2008, the financial crash struck the global property market. Bayrock was victim to the hit. Its mega-projects ended in foreclosure, the company was sold off, the investors were angry - and only the lawyers saw a profit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Disaster 3: Bayrock \\\"mob-owned and operated\\\"</div><div><p>In a 2010 complaint, the structure of the Bayrock group was laid bare - and the findings were ugly. Ex-finance director of Bayrock, Jody Kriss, claimed the subsidiaries of the Bayrock Group embezzled millions of dollars, defrauded the Internal Revenue Service and extorted money through threats of<a href=\\\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2638421/Kriss-v-Bayrock-Complaint.txt\\\"> torture and death</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He filed litigation against Bayrock, its directors and corporate affiliates,<a href=\\\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/09/18/Former_Exec_Says_Developer_Pulled_a_Fast_One.htm\\\"> including Arif</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The complaint alleged that Sater took eight million USD from Bayrock, Schwarz four million USD and Arif 15 million USD. The cash came &ldquo;from crime rather than legitimate profit&rdquo;. They evaded up to 20 million USD of their tax liabilities. There is no evidence Trump took&nbsp;part in, or knew about, this racket.</p><p>Under fire was a complex 2007 deal with the FL Group, an Icelandic firm, which culminated in Bayrock and FL becoming co-developers. The 'Icelanders' came with 50 million USD and intended to form a partnership to develop Bayrock's giant Trump projects. The complaint alleges the Bayrock bosses disguised FL Group as a &ldquo;lender&rdquo;, not a partner, to pretend the 50 million USD was a non-taxable loan. Thus the firm could avoid paying millions in tax.</p><p>When Kriss objected to the FL Group scheme, the complaint states that Sater &ldquo;made him an offer he couldn&rsquo;t refuse&rdquo; - either take 500,000 dollars, keep quiet, and leave all the rest of his money behind, or make trouble and be killed.</p><p>The Icelandic company, FL Group, was identified in a Bayrock investor presentation as a &ldquo;strategic partner,&rdquo; along with Alexander Mashkevitch.</p><p>But who was behind the FL Group? It was based in Iceland. Are we talking about Icelandic investors? It's not that simple.</p><p>Founded in 2005 by &ldquo;corporate viking&rdquo; Hannes Smarason, the fund bought and the sold stakes in low-frills airline EasyJet, and also owned a third of the Iceland-based Glitnir bank - the first finance group&nbsp;ofits kind &nbsp;to collapse in the crash of 2008.</p><p>After the disaster, the fund changed its name to Stodir and still had affiliates linked to Bayrock in 2014, but lost them that year to foreclosures.</p><p>But it appears the group was funded by Russians.</p><p>During the early negotiations between FL Group and Bayrock, the real estate group was approached by Novator, an Icelandic competitor of FL, which promised to enter into the same partnership with Bayrock as FL was contemplating, but on better terms.</p><p>&ldquo;Arif and Satter told Kriss that this would not be possible,\\\" states the complaint, \\\"because the money behind these companies was mostly Russian and the Russians behind FL were in favor with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, but the Russians behind Novator were not, and so they had to deal with FL.\\\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Trump Fort Lauderdale foreclosed, lay dormant for years and will now reopen under the Conrad brand (photo by Cliff (VA))\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/%20Fort%20Lauderdale%20Cliff%20(VA)%3AWikimedia%20Commons.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 399px;\\\"></p></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Disaster 4: Florida Collapse: buyers were \\\"misled\\\"</div><div><p>Bayrock and Trump's 200 million USD luxury condominium in Phoenix never happened, due to local opposition to the project's height.</p><p>They announced and then cancelled another Florida project called Trump Las Olas, and together pushed an unsuccessful venture in Colorado.</p><p>But they did manage to construct the Fort Lauderdale project of 298 condominium hotel rooms over&nbsp;240,000 square feet.</p><p>Arif stated: &ldquo;Bayrock Group is proud to partner with Donald J.

Except that it was a real-world example of the dark and lucrative business of buying stakes in football players, involving the game&rsquo;s biggest investment fund in Europe.</p><p>The business, known as Third Party Ownership, or TPO, centred on the purchase of a player&rsquo;s economic rights by individuals, companies or funds, who subsequently are entitled to a share of the player&rsquo;s future club transfer fees. The system was banned by world football governing body Fifa in May 2015. TPO deals were the speciality of Doyen Sports Investment, which is registered in Malta and operates out of offices in central London.</p><p>Documents in possession of Football Leaks, obtained by German weekly par Der Spiegel and analysed by the media network European Investigative Collaborations (EIC), lift the lid on the astonishing story behind the transfer of French midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia from Sevilla to Monaco in 2013.</p><p>It features a party with prostitutes organised for the president of Real Madrid, secret commissions paid into an account in the United Arab Emirates and conflicts of interest, all in disregard for the player concerned. The transfer, which is the subject of an investigation by Fifa, illustrates the baseness of Doyen Sports and the business side of football, blighted by the feverish quest for moneymaking.</p><p>On August 6th 2013, Nelio Lucas, the chief executive of Doyen Sports, landed in Miami. He was due to watch, the following day, football matches of an exhibition tournament: the final between R&eacute;al Madrid and Chelsea, followed by the small final between A.C. Milan and LA Galaxy.</p><p>There was no particular interest in these off-season friendlies, except for the millions of dollars paid out by the tournament&rsquo;s sponsor, the beer brand Guinness, to convince top clubs and their stars and managers to draw themselves into the damp and&nbsp;hot Florida summer.</p><p>Lucas had not made the trip to watch the teams play, but rather to earn money in the wings. Doyen Sports, which had been created barely two years earlier, had that June sealed its first major deal with the transfer of Colombian striker Radamel Falcao from Atl&eacute;tico Madrid to Monaco.</p><p>The cost of the transfer was 43 million Euro, and Doyen Sport owned 33 per cent&nbsp;of Falcao&rsquo;s economic rights. In Miami, Lucas was eyeing a new moneyspinner in the form of French midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia.</p><p>The year before, Doyen Sports had provided three&nbsp;million Euro&nbsp;to Spanish club Sevilla for the purchase of Kondogbia from French side Lens. Half of the sum was handed over as a loan, while the other half was in exchange for a 50 per cent&nbsp;investment in the player.</p><p>After one season in Spain, and after winning the under-20&nbsp;World Cup alongside team mate Paul Pogba, Kondogbia&rsquo;s value had jumped. Now was the moment to strike rich on the investment with a new transfer. The problem was that Sevilla had no wish to sell the Frenchman, and Fifa rules strictly prohibited investment funds from influencing transfer deals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">The first target: Real Madrid president Florentino Perez</div><p>But that was not enough to stop Doyen Sports. The player&rsquo;s contract with Sevilla included a 20-million-Euro&nbsp;release clause, and the only way to overcome Sevilla&rsquo;s refusal to sell Kondogbia was to find a club willing to pay the 20 million Euro. Lucas&rsquo;s first target was Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, president of the most powerful club in the world. To try to seduce Perez, Lucas attempted to bring him into a specially designed private party.</p><p>Lucas had a golden opportunity to achieve his plan. The family of Kazakh oligarchs who own the Doyen Group, whose main money-spinner is raw materials, posess a 650-square-metre residence on Fisher Island, a reserve for the wealthy, lying a short distance from Miami Beach.</p><p>Nelio Lucas was present at the sprawling property when, at 5.08 p.m. on August 6th 2013 he sent a message from his mobile phone via WhatsApp to Arif Arif, the 27-year-old son of Tevfik Arif, one the four Kazakh brothers who own the Doyen Group, and who runs their Doyen Sports subsidiary alongside Lucas.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in Miami,&rdquo; wrote Lucas. &ldquo;Yesterday was amazing. I took few presidents out and even Florentino came with us. Very funny. He removed his tie and danced.&rdquo; He added that the partying went on at the Mokai, a Miami Beach club where scantily-clad women are part of the d&eacute;cor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"I want to bring some girls to be with us\\\"</div><p>Lucas planned on upping the tempo that evening in the Arif&rsquo;s Fisher Island residence. &ldquo;Bro&hellip; very important,&rdquo; he wrote to Arif. &ldquo;I want to bring some girls to be with us, Florentino, Galliani [editor&rsquo;s note, Adriano Galliani, vice-president of A.C. Milan'&nbsp;and some directors. It's ok?&rdquo; Lucas also asked Arif if he can trust a women whose first name is Violet for the procurement of female company. &ldquo;Never met her bro,&rdquo; answers Arif Arif. &ldquo;Do what you have to.&rdquo;</p><p>Arif Arif, 27, set out two conditions, which were &ldquo;remove the pictures&rdquo; and &ldquo;lock the room&rdquo; of his father, Tevfik, who he nick-names &ldquo;Skip&rdquo;. Their exchange of messages continued:</p><ul>\\t<li>\\t<div>Arif: &ldquo;Use my room. A Lot of girls have been fucked in that room. The spirit is there! [&hellip;]</div>\\t</li>\\t<li>\\t<div>Lucas: &ldquo;It's where I am !!! I'm staying there&rdquo;</div>\\t</li>\\t<li>\\t<div>Arif: &ldquo;There you go.

Contacted by EIC, AC Minalo's Adriano Galliani and Real' Florentino Perez both firmly said that they've never set foot in the Arif family's Miami apartment.</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all. I don't know Arif family&rdquo;, Galliani replied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"I wasn't in any other place than a disco\\\"</div><p>Florentino Perez wrote in an email that he wish to express his &ldquo;indignation for the content of your questions that I consider attempt seriously against my honor and reputation&rdquo;.</p><p>Real Madrid's president remembers that he went to a nightclub in Miami with his friend Adriano Galliani, and the wives of the&nbsp;group, some of Real Madrid's executives and &ldquo;other people related to the football world&rdquo;.</p><p>But he says that he never went to the Arif's apartment: &ldquo;I wasn't in any other place than a disco&rdquo;. &ldquo;From&nbsp;what I can remember, during that Real Madrid tour, no one tried to persuade me to buy the player Kondogbia,&rdquo;&nbsp;he adds.</p><p>Did Nelio Lucas make a biased report of the events over the phone to impress Arif Arif? Anyway, two days later, just before leaving Miami to London, Lucas wrote another text message to Doyen Sports' co-CEO to tell him that Real Madrid refused the offer: &ldquo;Real pays only 15.&rdquo;</p><p>But he could console himself with the relationship he had built in Miami with Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, a powerful figure in the football business.</p><p>&ldquo;My relation there is more solid than titanium,&rdquo; wrote Lucas several months later. Perez, meanwhile, was cited on the Doyen Sports website extolling the &ldquo;professionalism&rdquo; of the company, and its &ldquo;importance for Spanish football&rdquo;.</p><p>While Real Madrid received no financing from Doyen Sports, &ldquo;our experience with them in other subjects is immaculate&rdquo; added Perez. Asked about this flattering opinion, he made the following answer to EIC: &ldquo;I can't say why in its webpage is quoted a phrase like the one you mentioned, that I don't remember to have ever said.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Geoffrey Kondogbia is not on the market\\\"</div><p>As Lucas was leaving Florida for the return flight to London on 9 August 2013, he sent a message to Arif, insisting &ldquo;I&rsquo;m killing my balls to find someone to pay the clause of Kondogbia&rdquo;. At a press conference three days later, the president of Sevilla, Jos&eacute; Maria Del Nido, apparently irritated over the media relay of rumours that the French midfielder was to be sold, made himself clear during a press conference:</p><p>&ldquo;Geoffrey Kondogbia is not on the market [&hellip;] He who wants him must [&hellip;] pay his release clause.&rdquo; Del Nido added that said he would consider any attempt to buy the player &ldquo;as an aggression&rdquo; and insisted he had made a deal with Doyen Sports, which owned 50% of Kondogbia, &ldquo;to reject any offer made this year&rdquo;.</p><p>But Lucas continued to search for a buyer ready to pay up the 20 million Euro&nbsp;for a 19-year-old who, however talented, was just 14 months earlier playing in France&rsquo;s second division with Lens. Arif Arif envisaged a deal with Manchester United, and wrote to Lucas in a phone text message, &ldquo;Surely you can force Moyes to pay?&rdquo;, a reference to the club&rsquo;s then manager David Moyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I will try&rdquo;, replied Lucas. But two days later he received a definitive no from the Red Devils. &ldquo;You know how United are, they only pay premium for fat Brazilian or Portuguese retards,&rdquo; Arif wrote in a text message to a friend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">A 524 per cent return on investment in one year</div><p>In the end it was Monaco who agreed to pay the 20 million Euro&nbsp;for Kondogbia&rsquo;s transfer to the French Riviera. &ldquo;Great deal for us,&rdquo; texted Lucas to Arif who replied: &ldquo;Congrats bro!!!!!!!&rdquo; The transfer deal, because of the company&rsquo;s 50 per cent&nbsp;stake in Kondogbia, gave Doyen Sport a net profit of 7.8 million Euro, which represented a return on its initial investment of 524 per cent&nbsp;in one year.</p><p>The young French midfielder had hoped to join a major European club instead.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope we didn&rsquo;t ruin his career,&rdquo; wrote Arif of the deal with Monaco. &ldquo;My heart is broken. I have more sympathy for this kid than for Falcao,&rdquo; he added, referring to the other Doyen plater, Colombian striker Radamel Falcao, who was also transferred to Monaco two months earlier.</p><p>&ldquo;Look to the bank account in few days and you will feel different,&rdquo; answered Lucas. &ldquo;I wanted the kid to move to a solid team and deliver one of the highest of levels so we can get the recognition we deserve,&rdquo; wrote Arif in a text message to a friend. &ldquo;But this ended up being a pure financial play.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"Secret commission of 1.3 million Euro\\\"</div><p>But the &ldquo;financial play&rdquo; was no less questionable than the partying in Miami. To smooth the transfers to Monaco of Kondogbia and Falcao, Football Leaks documents suggest that Lucas paid a secret commission of 1.3 million Euro. In June 2014, one year after the transfers, Lucas used the services of a shell company, Denos limited. This offshore structure is registered in Ras al-Khaimah, one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates and the most opaque of any of the Middle East tax havens.</p><p>Doyen Sports sent to Denos 10 per cent&nbsp;of the profits made on transfers. Lucas would explain in one message that this arrangement was for &ldquo;people we need to compensate&rdquo; and that &ldquo;we had no paperwork to support because the counterpart could not provide or didn't want to provide&rdquo;.</p><p>In one message to the Arif family, owners of Doyen Sports, concerning a payment to be made, Nelio suggests that he promised money and that there was growing impatience among the beneficiaries: &ldquo;We can't delay more. It's costing us other deals and is destroying my good name.&rdquo;</p><p>On 17 July 2014, Doyen Sports made an initial payment into Denos of 1.3 million Euro, of which 785,865 Euro&nbsp;concerned the transfer of Kondogbia and 533,190 Euro concerned that of Falcao. The Football Leaks documents do not reveal to whom the money was ultimately destined.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Transfer \\\"under FIFA investigation\\\"</div><p>Six months later, Fifa launched an investigation into Kondogbia&rsquo;s transfer to Monaco. On 6 January 2015, Kimberly Morris, head of Fifa&rsquo;s TMS Integrity and Compliance department wrote to Spanish club Sevilla asking for all the documents relative to the French midfielder&rsquo;s transfer to Monaco, the payment details, and in particular the payments linked to Doyen Sports.</p><p>&ldquo;Information available to us indicates that your club and/or a third party related to your club would have received payments in connection with this transfer,&rdquo; she wrote, reminding the club that any influence by exterior parties on the independence of transfer policies is an infringement of Fifa&rsquo;s rules.</p><p>Fifa also suspected that a secret payment of 500,000 Euro&nbsp;was made during Kondogbia&rsquo;s transfer from French club Lens to Sevilla in 2012.</p><p>The investigation followed a complaint lodged with the head of Fifa&rsquo;s legal affairs department in December 2014 by Italian football agent Gianluca Fiorini. The agent accused Doyen Sports of committing &ldquo;grave abuse&rdquo; during Kondogbia&rsquo;s move to Monaco because, he argued, it controlled both the player&rsquo;s agent and the agent for then Monaco manager Claudio Ranieri (who is now in charge of Leicester City).</p><p>Fiorini said he had discovered this during a conversation four months before the transfer with Spanish agent Juan Manuel Lopez who, according to the Italian, told him he was Kondogbia&rsquo;s agent. Fiorini said Lopez recounted that he had &ldquo;invested&rdquo; in Doyen Sports, just like his Italian colleague Giuseppe Bozzo, who was Ranieri&rsquo;s agent. The two agents are well connected to Doyen Sports: Lopez is one of Nelio Lucas&rsquo;s three principal professional collaborators, and Bozzo has been appointed by by Nelio Lucas as the exclusive representative for Doyen Sports in Italy.</p><p>The actors of this operations that accepted to answer to EIC all denied the accusation. Kondogbia's agent, Jonathan Maarek, says that he is the sole and only one representing Kondogbia, and that Juan Manuel Lopez has never been his agent.</p><p>Maarek adds that he has never been in contact with Ranieri while he was negotiating the transfer with AS Monaco. Giuseppe Bozzo states that he has only been working for Ranieri &ldquo;for a short period&rdquo; in 2011, and that he was not his agent during the operation. &ldquo;I have never been involved, in any way possible, to Kondgobia&rsquo;s transfer to Monaco&rdquo;, he adds. AS Monaco says that the club &ldquo;has no information concerning alleged agreements concerning M. Bozzo&rdquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"We didn't know about the investigation\\\"</div><p>According to information collected by EIC, the Fifa investigation ended in the beginning of 2016, and Sevilla has been sentenced to a formal warning and a fine amouting to 55,000 swiss francs. This sanction only concerns a minor aspect of the affair: in the contract between Doyen and Sevilla was stated that the club was forced to sell Kondogbia in case there's an offer of six million Euro&nbsp;or more. This clause has never been used by Doyen, but it has been considered illicit by Fifa, as it gave to the fund an important influence on the club's transfer policy. Sevilla appealed the sentence.</p><p>But Fifa's investigation seem to have been incomplete. Our knowledge is that Fifa didn't ask questions to the actors of the transfer who where quoted in the complaint as having conflicts of interest.</p><p>Both Giuseppe Bozzo and AS Monaco told EIC that they didn't know about the investigation and have never been contacted by Fifa about this matter. Fifa also seems to have failed to confirm the suspicions of hidden payments that were mentioned in its letter to Sevilla.</p><p>As we've already seen earlier, the Football Leaks documents show that Doyen paid a hidden commission of 785,865 Euro&nbsp;related to Kondogbia's transfer. The remaining question now is who has been the beneficiary of this money that traveled through Dubai.</p></div></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"f6819665-a51d-4b71-9590-6271f42a2ca7\"}]"}, "pk": 1276, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

But the speciality of Doyen Sports was the trade in Third-Party Ownership (TPO) of footballers, a decried system whereby a player&rsquo;s economic rights are owned in stakes by investors.</p><p>Doyen had invested more than 100 million Euro&nbsp;in TPO deals up until the practice was outlawed by football&rsquo;s governing body, Fifa - whose president Gianni Infantino likened the system to &ldquo;modern slavery&rdquo; - in May 2015.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"A transfer business resembling a cattle market\\\"</div><p>Documents contained in Football Leaks, obtained by German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, and transferred to the journalistic collective European Investigative Collaborations (EIC), reveal, for the first time, the dark side of Doyen Sports, which features shell companies in Malta and the United Arab Emirates, vast secret commissions to assist with player transfers, false billing and backdated contracts signed by frontmen.</p><p>The company, which has prospered from such methods amid wide indifference, is the symbol of a reality far removed from what goes on on the pitch. It is that of a transfer business resembling a cattle market, except that its&nbsp;yearly value reaches four&nbsp;billion Euro. It is a trade where scruples have long been jettisoned in the quest for riches.</p><p>The story of Doyen Sports begins with an improbable encounter between Nelio Lucas, the son of a Portuguese family of modest means and the son of a Kazakh businessman.</p><p>Lucas studied marketing communication and international politics in California, where he joined an agency representing showbusiness stars.</p><p>&ldquo;I looked after Mariah Carey, I&rsquo;ve been road manager for Bruce Springsteen,&rdquo; he told French daily Lib&eacute;ration in October 2015.</p><p>In the early 2000s he returned to Europe, where he ran foul of the law, picking up fines for tax evasion, driving without a licence and issuing a rubber cheque. In London he began working for a successful Israeli football agent, Pini Zahavi, who taught him the trade, before the two men eventually fell out. Lucas managed a modelling agency before he was eventually hired to launch Doyen Sports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Imagine us in ten&nbsp;years. Inshallah kings&rdquo;&nbsp;</div><p>The owners of Doyen Sports Investment are four brothers from Kazakhstan who are now based in the Turkish city of Istanbul, and who made their fortune notably in the business of raw materials. In 2011, the Arif brothers created a London branch of their Doyen group, including a sports division. Arif Arif, the then 25-year-old son of Tevfik Arif, one of the four brothers, was given the job of managing the London business, running the newly-created Doyen Sports alongside the recruited Nelio Lucas.</p><p>Lucas and Arif appeared to get on well together, both ambitious and hungry to make money. &ldquo;Imagine us in ten&nbsp;years. Inshallah kings,&rdquo; Arif wrote to Lucas. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget our lemma: together forever on good and bad. We will succeed and we will become billionaires,&rdquo; Lucas told Arif. On his path to reach that goal, Lucas bought himself a Bentley for 72,000 Euro and a yacht for 3.5 million Euro.</p><p>The two young men travelled together to football matches, to plush London restaurants and enjoyed trips to Ibiza, Italy and the French Riviera where they stayed in the luxury villa of the Arif family in Antibes. In 2013, Arif Arif went househunting in London. &ldquo;Found a real nice one,&rdquo; he told Lucas. &ldquo;Want to show you. Tailor made for orgies.&rdquo; To which Lucas replied: &ldquo;Oh yes !!!&rdquo;</p><p>At Halloween, Lucas was dithering between wearing a disguise as pope, Napoleon or Louis XV. &ldquo;For me the dictator,&rdquo; Arif told him.</p><p>Their text message exchanges on WhatsApp suggest that for them, football players are merely cash cows. In 2014, Arif lists to Lucas his player clients playing in that year&rsquo;s World Cup in Brazil. &ldquo;Mangala, Promes, Defour, Januzaj, Xavi, Falcao, Rojo, Negredo, de Gea&hellip; Doyen Sports niggas going to World Cup! &rdquo;</p><p>When Neymar&rsquo;s Brazil team qualified for the semi-finals, Arif wrote to Lucas: &ldquo;Neymar bitch.

[&hellip;] He will end up paying taxes in France.&rdquo;\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/GettyImages-604259172.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 700px; height: 474px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Do you thing I should bribe them?\\\"</div><p>The comments about players turned particularly nasty if a footballer chose his own interests before those of Doyen Sports. One such case was that of Moroccan player Abdel Barrada, in who Doyen Sports had a 60 per cent&nbsp;TPO stake. In 2013, the midfielder left Getafe, a club close to Madrid, for United Arab Emirates side Al-Jazira. It appeared that for Lucas, the 3.35 million Euro&nbsp;that Doyen received from the transfer &ndash; equivalent to twice it paid for its TPO stake two years earlier &ndash; was a disappointment.</p><p>He wrote to Arif: &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t control him more. [&hellip;] If the player had listen to me I will get more&hellip; but fucking muslim.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a similar story with Colombian striker Radamel Falcao who, also in the summer of 2013, moved from Atl&eacute;tico Madrid to Monaco, a transfer managed by his agent Jorge Mendes. The transfer fee was 43 million Euro, which earned Doyen, with a 33 per cent&nbsp;stake in the player, a profit of 5.3 million Euro. But Lucas had apparently hoped for greater returns from Falcao.</p><p>&ldquo;He went to Monaco that fuck,&rdquo; he wrote Arif, before insulting the Colombian player&rsquo;s mother and concluding: &ldquo;His career is finished. [&hellip;] He will end up paying taxes in France.&rdquo;</p><p>For Doyen Sports Investment, it would appear that tax is a most unpleasant word. The company is based in Malta, giving it a respectable European Union base while also offering the appealing compromise of a clement tax regime and business secrecy.</p><p>Nelio Lucas owns two offshore companies registered there, hidden behind front names. One of them is WGP, which holds the 20 per cent in Doyen Sports, which were offered to him by the Arif family. The second, called Vela and which has a bank account in Liechtenstein, handles the yearly 900,000 Euro that remunerate Lucas and his colleagues. The Portuguese also has an account with the Cr&eacute;dit Suisse bank in Zurich. The reason, in his own words, is &ldquo;in order for nobody to disclose nothing about us&rdquo;.</p><p>Nelio Lucas was offered a 20 per cent&nbsp;stake in Doyen Natural Resources, one of the group&rsquo;s Panama companies which it owns via a shell company in the British Virgin Islands. When he was not buying into footballers, Lucas travelled to negotiate mining deals in Brazil, Sierra Leone and Angola, three countries steeped in corruption.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you thing I should bribe them???&rdquo; he asked Arif in one message about his dealings in Brazil. &ldquo;Yes bro,&rdquo; came the reply. The business deal collapsed apparently after the other party tried to bribe Lucas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Buy a million of those birth control pills\\\"</div><p>But the speciality of Lucas was above all TPO deals. Doyen Sports acted like a sort of usurer in the world of football, obtaining prohibitive interest rates for clubs in financial crisis and which are forced to sell their team jewels.</p><p>The system was that Doyen Sports would buy from a club a stake in a player, in the hope that he would rapidly be sold on at a good profit for Doyen Sports, who received a proportionate share of the transfer fee paid by the new club. Officially, Doyen Sports has no influence over transfer decisions, as stipulated in Fifa rules. But in practice, it was otherwise.</p><p>Almost every means was worth employing for Doyen Sports to clinch a deal. In August 2013, Lucas organised a sex party in Miami in an attempt <a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1276&amp;recType=story\\\">to convince Real Madrid boss Florentino Perez</a> to buy Geoffrey Kondogbia in which Doyen Sports had invested a stake.</p><p>On 14 occasions between March 2014 and September 2015, Lucas shuttled around pretty young women from Minsk, Moscow and Saint Petersburg to help with business deals, the plane tickets paid by his offshore company Vela. Some of the women were models. Another, whose first name is Kateryna, boasts on her Twitter account that she is a &ldquo;Beautiful woman - a paradise for the eyes, hell for the mind and purgatory for the pockets&rdquo;.</p><p>Excepting the case of a pair of women brought to Ibiza for two days of partying, Lucas used the female company exclusively on business trips. Some joined him for Champions League matches, such as the semi-final in April 2014 between Real Madrid-Bayern Munich at Real Madrid&rsquo;s Santiago Bernabeu home stadium. The women also accompanied him on business trips to Madrid, Barcelona, Brussels and Athens.</p><p>One of the trips, in the late summer of 2015, was particularly profitable. On 26 August&nbsp;2015, Lucas travelled to Madrid with a blonde-haired woman called Sabina for the signing of the transfer of Spanish midfielder Asier Illarramendi from Real Madrid to Real Sociedad. Five days later, Sabina travelled to Marseille with Lucas and the&nbsp;Portuguese defender&nbsp;Rolando Fonseca, where he was to be transferred from Portuguese club Porto.</p><p>Did Lucas seek the company of the women for his personal interest? Do they help bolster his status during negotiations? Or are they placed at the disposition of his business partners, as in the case of Miami with the president of real Madrid? He would not reply.</p><p>While Nelio Lucas appears to have no trouble finding the women, Arif Arif meanwhile appeared to be a compulsive client of prostitutes, including one he described as an &ldquo;18 year old blonde, so tender and fresh&rdquo;.</p><p>In one message to a Doyen Sports staff member he wrote:</p><p>&ldquo;Buy a million of those birth control pills. The 72 hours. They don&rsquo;t sell them in London unless you go with the girl.&rdquo;</p><p>The subject of prostitutes is openly discussed by the two Doyen Sports managers: &ldquo;It would be nice if you can get me those 2500 GBP, I paid the bitches!!!&rdquo; wrote Lucas to Arif in July 2013.</p><p>There is of course nothing illegal in associating with prostitutes. But Arif Arif appears keen to bring them from east&nbsp;Europe, via two intermediaries, one of whom is a cousin. In exchanges on the subject, he carefully uses the words &ldquo;footballers&rdquo; and &ldquo;players&rdquo;, as in this message: &ldquo;Organise footballers now. Don't fucking waste time, we're gonna end up like last night with nothing!!!!&rdquo;</p><p>That was replied to three hours later with a photo of one woman. The intermediary informs him that he is going to take part in a &ldquo;big casting this weekend&rdquo; organised by Russian gas-producing giant Gazprom.</p><p>Did Arif Arif use his network to find the women who Lucas used in his business dealings?</p><p>The Arif family would not answer questions. Through their lawyers, the family told the European Investigative Collaborations and partner Der Spiegel&nbsp;that: \\\"Essential parts of your questions are based on untrue assumptions and/or concern issues, which are protected by the personal&nbsp;rights of the named persons.\\\"</p><p>As of the autumn of 2013, Nelio Lucas decided to use funds hidden in three shell companies based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), including the capital Abu Dhabi and Ras al-Khaimah.</p><p>Doyen Sports was to pump 10.8 million Euro&nbsp;of secret commissions into the companies, called Denos, Rixos and PMCI. The documents contained in the Football Leaks dossiers, do not reveal to whom the money was destined at the end of the chain, but they provide several clues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"People you need to compensate\\\"</div><p>The first of the major deals concerned by the commissions involved Belgian international and Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj.</p><p>In February 2014, Doyen Sports bought half of the company that managed Januzaj&rsquo;s image rights, for a payment of 1.5 million Euro, and a second payment of 500,000 Euro&nbsp;that transited via Denos with a false &ldquo;consulting&rdquo; contract and a false invoice. In an email sent by Lucas, this was described as &ldquo;pay Januzaj&ldquo;, in what appeared to be a move to give the player a bonus payment through offshore structures.</p><p>On 22 May&nbsp;2014, a lawyer representing Januzaj wrote to a female colleague of Lucas to complain: &ldquo;The payment is not yet received. [&hellip;] Now the father is really getting nervous.&rdquo;</p><p>In the summer of 2014, the system became more frequent. Lucas demanded that ten per cent&nbsp;of profits from each player transfer should be paid into Denos in Dubai. The first secret commission payment, of 1.3 million Euro, concerned the sale to Monaco in the summer of 2013 of French midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia and also Colombian forward Radamel Falcao.</p><p>Lucas would explain that the transfer was to pay &ldquo;people that we need to compensate&rdquo; and who &ldquo;could not provide or didn't want to provide paperwork&rdquo;. He added that he had promised the recipients this but that they were losing patience waiting to receive the payments.</p><p>&ldquo;We can't delay more,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;It's costing us other deals and is destroying my good name.&rdquo; Arif Arif had wanted to know more about the identities of the recipients but his father, Tevfik Arif, one of the four brothers who control the Doyen group, told him &ldquo;to stay out of it&rdquo;.</p><p>Tevfik Arif ordered his accountants to release the money, despite their concern that no contracts were submitted.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s playing dirty because we are,&rdquo; wrote Tevfik Arif. &ldquo;[&hellip;] But the payments he owes will not go anywhere either.&rdquo;</p><p>One month later, the secret funds would serve to oil a major operation. In August 2014, English club Manchester City bought French central defender Eliaquim Mangala from Portuguese club FC Porto for 45 million Euro, which was an all-time record for a defender. It was also to provide Doyen Sports with its most profitable return on a TPO investment. With a 33 per cent&nbsp;stake in Mangala, Doyen Sports earned ten&nbsp;million Euro&nbsp;in the deal, which was four times the price they paid for the stake.</p><p>Then, on 2 September, just five days after receiving the money, Lucas wrote to Doyen&rsquo;s banker to arrange that two&nbsp;million Euro&nbsp;be transferred on to shell company PMCI in Abu Dhabi. That represented 20 per cent&nbsp;of the profit made on the transfer of Eliaquim Mangala, twice the usual ten per cent&nbsp;that was siphoned off abroad.</p><p>As justification for the bank transfer, Lucas sent to the Doyen banker an unsigned contract according to which PMCI had carried out consultancy work for Mangala&rsquo;s transfer. Once more, the beneficiary of the sum remains a mystery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Spiegel-Doyen-eng.png\\\" style=\\\"width: 805px; height: 662px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Franco-Algerian midfielder Yacine Brahimi grew up in France and began his senior career with Rennes before later moving on loan to Spanish club Granada in 2012, signing a permanent deal with the Spaniards in 2013.</p><p>In the summer of 2014, Portuguese side Porto announced that it had bought the player for 6.5 million Euro. In reality, Brahimi cost the Portuguese 9.5 million Euro, of which eight&nbsp;million Euro&nbsp;was paid for by Doyen Sports in exchange for an 80 per cent&nbsp;stake in the player.</p><p>Doyen Sports had in all secrecy bought up the stake in Brahimi of another investor, which avoided a commission payment for Rennes which, according to Lucas, had &ldquo;a share in the profit of the future transfer&rdquo;. Porto paid a commission of 500,000 Euro&nbsp;into the account of Doyen Sports shell company Denos, in Dubai. Because Lucas did not have an agent&rsquo;s licence it was his colleague Juan Manuel Lopez who signed the contract papers.</p><p>The following year, on 29 July&nbsp;2015, Lucas organised the secret payment of 1.5 million Euro&nbsp;for Brahimi, via Denos.</p><p>&ldquo;Brahimi is our priority even because it might happen a deal this summer!&rdquo; wrote Lucas. The nature of the deal was unclear. A few days later, on 4 August, Lucas was concerned that the process of payment was taking too long. &ldquo;Is this paid?&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Need that swift today [&hellip;] Player wants to speak with club and will be embarrassing for me.&rdquo;</p><p>The money was finally transferred on 10 August. One month later, Brahimi successfully renegotiated his contract with Porto and which concluded in the club buying up his image rights for four million Euro.</p><p>Lucas received 500,000 Euro&nbsp;in a commission payment from Porto, which was sent into Lucas&rsquo;s Maltese-registered company Vela via its Liechtenstein bank account. Vela was also given a mandate for the future sale of Brahimi, along with a 10 per cent&nbsp;commission on whatever sum that would be for. It was a quite extraordinary situation given that Lucas headed Doyen Sports which itself owned an 80 per cent&nbsp;stake in Brahimi.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Brahimi player transfer: Doyen Sports' Nelio Lucas received 500,000 Euro in a commission from Porto, which was sent to his Maltese company Vela \\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/GettyImages-484153912.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 700px; height: 467px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"Because Nelio Lucas&nbsp;did not have a&nbsp;Fifa agent&rsquo;s licence, he used front men\\\"</div><p>The Brahimi deal&nbsp;was not the only example of how Lucas would do business in his own name as well as that of Doyen Sports, via his shell company Vela, in which his name is never apparent. Because he did not have a Fifa agent&rsquo;s licence, which was necessary until 2015, he used front men, including three business colleagues who in parallel work as agents.</p><p>On 20 August&nbsp;2014, Maltese Fifa-licensed football agent Kevin Caruana, now working on the island in the financial sector, wrote to Doyen Sports to propose his professional services after he had seen the company was registered in Malta.</p><p>His proposition arrived with perfect timing for Lucas was on the point of receiving a 1.6-million Euro&nbsp;commission for his role in the transfer of Spanish defender Alberto Moreno from Spanish side Sevilla to English club Liverpool. Lucas needed a frontman agent to sign the contract on Vela&rsquo;s behalf.</p><p>Lucas&rsquo;s lawyer was concerned about involving Caruana. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know who this person is, he didn&rsquo;t participate in the operation, and we don&rsquo;t understand the presence of another person who is not Nelio,&rdquo; he wrote. Lucas was under pressure to sign the contract himself. Meanwhile, Sevilla refused to pay the commission into Vela&rsquo;s Liechtenstein account because the Spanish tax authorities had black-listed the principality.</p><p>Lucas concluded that he would have to use his Swiss bank account with Cr&eacute;dit Suisse, but he was concerned. &ldquo;But what will be the tax implication for me?&rdquo; he asked, in a message to his Swiss financial affairs advisor who managed Lucas&rsquo;s offshore structures. &ldquo;Also not sure if good idea to disclose my account,&rdquo; he added. The expert replied: &ldquo;As long as you do so and do not use a UK account I do not envisage problems. Obviously if you use the money from your account [&hellip;] it will be difficult to argue towards the tax authorities that it is not your money.&rdquo;</p><p>For Doyen Sports, it appears there is no profit that was to be overlooked. Porto defender Sergio de Oliveira was released on a free transfer by his club to move to a modest Portuguese side. But in January 2015, shortly after Doyen Sports had begun representing the player, Porto decided to ask him back with Doyen Sport&rsquo;s financial help. The process was steeped in a conflict of interests, because Doyen Sports was Sergio de Oliveira&rsquo;s agent, also holding a 25% stake in the player which it had bought for 500,000 Euro&nbsp;from Porto, while Lucas was paid a 300,000 Euro commission as agent for Porto.</p><p>Because Portuguese law prohibits a person or company from representing more than one party in a transfer deal, Lucas turned to the Maltese Kevin Caruana who signed for the 300,000 Euro-commission (to be paid via Vela). Caruana was paid 2,000 Eurp&nbsp;for his services. Shortly afterwards, Caruana wrote to Lucas to ask him to &ldquo;introduce me to the Porto people&rdquo;, the very same people he was officially supposed to have done business with in the Sergio de Oliveira deal.</p><p>Lucas&rsquo;s wealth and networking opened doors even in countries where the practice of TPO had always been outlawed, such as in France. Doyen Sports has had a good working relationship with Monaco, which in 2014 gave it the mission of finding new marketing contracts for the club in exchange for a ten per cent&nbsp;commission on the deals. Lucas also had excellent relations with Vincent Labrune, who from 2011 until July this year was president of Marseille football club.</p><p>&ldquo;In 2014, I had many meetings with [French] League 1 clubs,&rdquo; Lucas told French daily Lib&eacute;ration in October last year. \\\"They came to me to find solutions. I hear [Lyon] chairman Jean-Michel Aulas criticised investment funds. But Lyon is one of those clubs [&hellip;] Vincent Ponsot [Lyon club director] sent me a thousand messages to tell me that Aulas wanted to meet me.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;These cocksuckers want to bash third party ownership continually&rdquo;&nbsp;</div><p>Fifa&rsquo;s move to ban TPO deals, which would take effect in May 2015, was naturally unwelcome for Doyen Sports. The ban prevents anyone other than clubs from holding a stake in a player&rsquo;s economic rights.</p><p>&ldquo;These cocksuckers want to bash third party ownership continually,&rdquo; wrote Arif Arif of journalists critical of the TPO system. In November 2014, one month before Fifa representatives were to vote over the then proposed ban on TPO deals, there was a rush of activity at Doyen Sports. Lucas sent a note out to his staff insisting on the urgency to do deals while time allowed, citing three players, one Brazilian and two Spanish, in who he wanted to buy a stake.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s now coming a moment that will affect badly our business as deals as we been doing are probably going to be forbidden,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;[&hellip;] So we should focus in make new deals now, THE MAXIMUM WE CAN.&rdquo;</p><p>After the Fifa ban was introduced in May 2015, which began with a transitional period, Lucas attempted in vain to buy on his personal account 25 per cent&nbsp;of French midfielder Gilbert Imbula during the latter&rsquo;s transfer from Marseille to Porto. Doyen Sports, meanwhile, tried buying into players in lower divisions.</p><p>In November 2015, six months after the Fifa ban came into effect, Doyen Sports bought stakes in two players with Spanish second division side Cadix, at a total cost of 1.5 million Euro. The partners to the deal agreed a clause by which the sale of the stakes purchased would be validated only if and when the Fifa ban was overturned. Until then, the money that was paid served as a loan.</p><p>Because only clubs are now allowed to hold a stake in players, Lucas turned to buying a stake in clubs, with the aim of again taking a cut in a transfer fee when the club sells a player. In July 2015, he attempted to buy a stake in Spanish club Granada via one of the Dutch companies at his service in what he referred to as a tax-free environment.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to close urgently with Granada and I need the structure,&rdquo; Lucas wrote to his lawyers on 15 July 2015. In the end, the Spanish club preferred a deal with Chinese investors.</p><p>Lucas also became involved with a protracted attempt by Thai financier Bee Taechaubol to invest in Italian club AC Milan. After months of talks, in May 2015 Taechaubol appeared on the cusp of buying out 48 per cent&nbsp;owned by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s Fininvest company.</p><p>Taechaubol appointed Doyen Sports as an advisor for the deal. It appears likely that Doyen Sports&rsquo; involvement was the result of Lucas&rsquo;s friendship with Adriano Galliani, the club&rsquo;s vice-president, and whose daughter is employed by Doyen Sports. On 10 June 2015, Taechaubol published a photo on his Instagram account showing Lucas and Galliani shaking hands in a private jet, alongside the caption: &ldquo;Building together under the guidance of the President.&rdquo;</p><p>But the deal eventually fell through. For even though Bee Taechaubol insists he remains in the bidding, Berlusconi this summer agreed to sell the club to a Chinese investment group in a deal yet to be finalised.</p><p>In November 2015, Football Leaks published details of a TPO deal struck between Doyen Sports and Dutch club FC Twente. The revelation of the underhand agreement resulted in the club being banned by the Dutch football association from European competitions for three years, while the club was also handed a 170,000Eeuro fine by Fifa.</p><p>Meanwhile, Doyen Sports has mounted legal challenges to the TPO ban, which have so far failed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"b73c5122-5199-47eb-8919-b7afeeea9d8e\"}]"}, "pk": 1277, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

On board was Tevfik &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; Arif and a cabal of influential businessmen, mostly from Kazakhstan, being entertained by several young 'models'&nbsp;from Russian and Eastern Europe.</p><p>Months earlier, acting on a tip from an unnamed source, police began tapping the phones of a group of Turkish pimps and associates of Tevfik.

Then again as they prepared the bash on the Savarona.</p><p>After the police sting operation that morning in September, Arif was arrested on sex trafficking charges. For many in Turkey, it was the first time they had heard of the Kazakh-born businessman now accused of running a prostitution enterprise that included underage girls.</p><p>The charges against him might have been ambitious, but the new fame was unwelcome and problematic. The sting had exposed Arif&rsquo;s powerful, billionaire friends to the media spotlight. [Read in more depth, our investigation here:&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1274&amp;recType=story\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Kazakh moguls, the pal of Donald Trump, teen models and the yacht of the 'Father of the Turks'</a>]</p><p>On board the yacht was the &lsquo;Kazakh trio&rsquo;, Alexander Mashkevich, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov. The three men, none of whom are from Kazakhstan, own&nbsp;the multi-billion Eurasian Natural Resources Company, a mining conglomerate with close ties to the President Nursultan Nazarbayev.</p><p>So, too, was Russian-Chechen tycoon, Musa Bazhaev, head of Alliance Group in Russia. Bazhaev&rsquo;s Chechen family is linked to the mafia wars of the early 90s, say Russian media, when criminal groups battled to gain control of the region&rsquo;s natural resources, and used forged bank papers to embezzle billions through the post-soviet financial system.</p><p>Around the time of the Savarona incident, Bazhaev, who inherited Alliance Group in 2000 following the death of his brother Zia (who was son-in-law of Nazarbayev),&nbsp;was attempting to convince Mashkevich to join a prospective oil deal between Alliance Group and CapFox Congo, owned by Khulubuse Zuma, nephew of the South African president, Jacob Zuma.</p><p>Curiously, despite renting the yacht for the week, and not for the first time, Mashkevich, former-president of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress, was never questioned by Turkish authorities.

Little is known about the other three, but Tevfik, an ethnic Turk born in Cambul, Kazakhstan in May 1953, earned an international relations degree from a university in Moscow. His first known job was in the USSR Ministry of Commerce and Trade in Kazakhstan in the late 70s, serving as the director of the department of hotel management.</p><p>With the end of Communism imminent and Soviet state assets ripe to be plundered, Tevfik shifted in to the private sector. During the Savarona trial, Tevfik stated that he &ldquo;worked in energy sector, chemical sector and metallurgy sector. I was producing coal in Russia and copper in Kazakhstan. Due to lack of coal, it was not possible to make production. I started to organise them&rdquo;. Indeed, in 1991, he retired from the ministry and started his own private commercial enterprise, called the Speciality Chemicals Trading Co. trading in &ldquo;chrome, rare metals and raw materials.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before Tevfik&rsquo;s business brought him into contact with the Reuben Brothers, David and Simon. Natives of India living in London, the ruthlessly ambitious Reubens were at the time in the early days of monopolising the region&rsquo;s natural resource industry through their company, Trans World Group. Tevfik joined them as an &ldquo;agent on the ground&rdquo; in Kazakhstan, according to the company&rsquo;s internal documents. &nbsp;</p><p>Trans World started around 1991 as a cooperation between and the Reubens and Uzbekistan-born Israeli oligarchs, Lev and Michael Cherney. It was the successor to Trans Commodities, an import/export business of Ukrainian entrepreneur Semyon &ldquo;Sam&rdquo; Kislin, who employed the Cherneys in the late 1980s.</p><p>The Kislin family, especially Sam, who emigrated to the U.S. from the Soviet Union in the early 70s through President Brezhnev&rsquo;s exit-visa programme for Russian Jews, is mentioned by several FBI and secret service reports as being part of the Solntsevskaya Russian mafia group in New York &ndash; more precisely the Yaponchik organization of Vyacheslav Ivankov, a particularly brutal mobster, <a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/files/Kislin-The-Center-for-Public-Integrity.pdf\\\" onclick=\\\"window.open(this.href, ', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;\\\">according to reports</a>.</p><p>Over the next few years, The Cherneys and the Reuben Brothers spearheaded Trans World into a multi-billion-dollar behemoth in the natural resources sector, as it became the third biggest seller of aluminium in the world. To get to the top, the brothers played dirty -&nbsp;criminally dirty, say some.</p><p>It was during these years that the Arifovs likely crossed paths with the Kazakh trio. In an interview with EIC&rsquo;s Belgium partner, Le Soir, Patokh Chodiev said that he, Mashkevich and Ibragimov first met the Reubens in Spring 1992. At the time, the trio were making billions selling copper on the international market through their British Virgin Islands company, Kazakhstan Mineral Resources Corporation, with the help of Kazakh officials.</p><p>Seeing a mutual interest, the Kazakh trio and the Reubens joined forces. They set up a network of offshore companies in the BVI, including one named KazChrome. It could not have hurt the fortunes of Tevfik, the Reubens or the Kazakh trio that Refik Arif, also born in Kazakhstan, in 1961, was from 1991 to 1999 senior manager at the Kazakh Ministry of Industry, and the &ldquo;first point of contact for foreign investors wanting wishing to invest in phosphorous and ferroalloy&rdquo;.</p><p>The eye-watering profits available during the post-Soviet fire sale inspired the rise of &lsquo;gangster capitalism&rsquo;, so-called because of the emerging cross-over of business and the mafia. Events in the region turned criminal &ndash; and deadly. The &lsquo;Aluminium wars&rsquo; of the 1990s were a bloody battleground. Industrialists, like the Reubens and Cherneys, were accused of hiring contract killers to murder their competition in the aluminium sector.</p><p>The Reuben brothers would be <a href=\\\"http://www.reubenbrothers.com/aluminium-%E2%80%B2risk-taker%E2%80%B2-changes-tack-in-russia/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">forced to sell</a> most of their assets in Russia and Kazakhstan. And based on these early deals, mostly with aluminium, a new wave of oligarchs emerged, such as Boris Berezovsky, and, later, Oleg Deripaska and Roman Abramovich.</p><p>By the end of the 1990s, the fight for soviet resources had mostly shifted from the streets and into the courts, usually London. These lawsuits provide extensive details of this period of lucrative partnership between Soviet and Russian secret services, high-ranking officials and top mobsters.</p><p>Arif is, during these years, intimately linked to the three main elements gluing post-Soviet&rsquo;s violent entrepreneurs and secret services together: Trans World and mineral resources, mob organizations in the US and western European, and global financial structures that were built to serve them.</p><p>It seemed from the beginning, however, the 40-year-old Tevfik did not have the taste for blood. Tevfik&rsquo;s son Arif later told a colleague his father left Kazakhstan &ldquo;once the business began intertwining with organised crime&rdquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">A toxic fortune</div><p>Tofic Arifov moved to Turkey in 1993, where, public records state, he had&nbsp;owned&nbsp;a jewellery business called Alset Dis Ticaret (English) since 1979. Within a year, he obtained a Turkish passport and Turkified his name to &lsquo;Tevfik Arif&rsquo;. Reliable information about Tevfik&rsquo;s early days in Turkey is scarce. But in the Savarona indictment, he said that he did some business in the tourist and jewellery sector there, but emigrated with his wife and children to the U.S. shortly after, starting a real estate business that would eventually bring him onto contact with President-Elect Trump.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the late 1990s that the family began to make its mark on Turkey and the rest of the world. But this expansion could not have occurred without the family&rsquo;s solid cash source from back home &ndash; and its crucial connection to the Kazakh trio. In the mid-90s, the Arifs acquired the Aktyubinsk Chromium Chemicals Plant (ACCP) in Aktobe, located in the Aktyubinsk region of north-western Kazakhstan, near the border with Russia.</p><p>ACCP was registered to Refik Arif while he was still an official in the Ministry of Industry in Kazakhstan. Twenty years later, the plant is the only producer of chromium-based chemical products in the country. The Aktobe plant, according to a 2002 <a href=\\\"https://archive.org/stream/springer_10.1007-978-94-007-1050-4/10.1007-978-94-007-1050-4_djvu.txt\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">NATO Science Committee report</a>, was&nbsp;responsible for pouring toxins into the local water supply, rendering it undrinkable.</p><p>Housed in the same town as ACCP is KazChrome, part of the empire established during the Kazakh trio&rsquo;s ventures with the Reubens in the early 1990s, and which is now solely in the hands of ENRC.

The loan, which was supposed to be repaid within 20 days, remained outstanding at the time of the exiled Russian&rsquo;s mysterious&nbsp;death&nbsp;in 2013.</p><p>Berezovky spent much of his past few years locked in an ill-fated legal battle with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who he unsuccessfully argued had robbed him of billions of dollars in shares, including in Rusal - Abramovich's aluminium operation that subsumed the Chernoy's business. &nbsp;</p><p>Tamince and Arif have been partners since at least 1999, when Tevfik invested three million dollars in the Labada project - a five-star, all-inclusive hotel&nbsp;on the coast of Antalya, Turkey.</p><p>At that time Tamince was already a respectable entrepreneur, famous for escaping his humble beginnings as a teenage carpet seller and establishing himself as a successful jeweller. The Labada was one of his first moves into Turkey&rsquo;s lucrative tourism industry, and Rixos and Sembol were established to complete the construction.</p><p>The same year, Tamince and Tevfik started an import-export enterprise, Sardes Mucevherat Ticaret AS, importing luxury jewellery to Turkey.

In 2004, when G&uuml;len and Erdo&#287;an were on tentatively friendly terms, Tamince told Turkish media that he considered the cleric an &ldquo;idol&rdquo;. Later, when he became wealthy, he gave money to the group.</p><p>Tamince would cut ties with the organisation in 2013, when G&uuml;len and Erdo&#287;an engaged in open conflict for control of Turkey&rsquo;s institutions, declaring that he had been tricked by G&uuml;len and that he was &ldquo;in love with Erdo&#287;an&rdquo;.</p><p>The power of the G&uuml;len movement in Turkey extends to the&nbsp;judiciary and law enforcement institutions. This might explain how Tamince may have&nbsp;cautioned Tevfik in April 2010 that police were tapping the phones of many of his employees, trying to gather evidence&nbsp;about sex trafficking [an accusation which Tamince denies].</p><p>According to the Savarona indictment transcript, on 27 April, 'Uncle' Gunduz - Gunduz Akdeniz, a man close to Tevfik who was involved in the Sardes jewellery company -&nbsp; calls Tevfik with a warning: &ldquo;Two or three days ago, Fettah Bey came to Istanbul, talked to Vakyf [Vakif Arif] Bey, told [him] man-to-man&rdquo; about the surveillance, apparently active for &ldquo;about a year or two already.&rdquo; A lawyer involved in the case confirmed that &lsquo;Fettah Bey&rsquo; is Fettah Tamince.</p><p>In response to questions by The Black Sea, Tamince said, &ldquo;I have no relationship or contact with the after mentioned person G&uuml;nd&uuml;z Akdeniz.&rdquo; [sic]</p><p>He also denied any involvement with Tevfik Arif, saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any partnership with Tevfik Arif.

Tevfik was seemingly impressed with the future president, even sending Arif Arif to the same New York military academy Trump attended in the early 1960s.</p><p>Tevfik appointed Burak Yenero&#287;lu as president of Bayrock. Yenero&#287;lu, who lives in a mansion opposite Tevfik in Miami, is closely associated with the Turkic-American Alliance, a known G&uuml;lenist organisation.

In 1991, he stabbed a fellow broker in the face with a glass during an argument in a New York bar and spent a year in jail.</p><p>According to U.S. <a href=\\\"http://licensedtolie.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Palmer-Petition-for-a-writ-of-certiorari-14-676.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Supreme Court documents</a>, upon his release Sater embarked on a &ldquo;&lsquo;pump-and-dump&rsquo; penny stock fraud in partnership with \\\"Russian and La Cosa Nostra career criminals.\\\" The mafia scam involved inflating the prices of near-worthless company shares before offloading them for massive profit, &ldquo;bilking investors of at least $40,000,000&rdquo; in the process. It would lead to his second conviction &ndash; this time for securities fraud and racketeering &ndash; in 1998. &nbsp;</p><p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the end of Sater. Following his conviction, he cut a confidential witness deal with the FBI and the New York United States Attorney's Office of Loretta Lynch &ndash; now Attorney General. He agreed to spy on his Russian mafia friends in return for keeping his convictions secret from banks and investors during development projects.</p><p>This pact, says the Supreme Court petition, &ldquo;facilitated&rdquo; Sater&rsquo;s effort to &ldquo;commit a billion dollars of continuing predicate crime during the ten years following his conviction&rdquo; - the same period he headed Bayrock. Incidentally, in the mid-2000s he was appointed as a senior advisor to Rixos and Sembol, a position&nbsp;he still holds. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sater&rsquo;s criminal career was of little concern to the Arifs as Bayrock grew rapidly in the property market worldwide, using its hidden connection to Rixos and Sembol to boast to investors about real estate transactions &ldquo;valued in excess of $2.5 billion USD&rdquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Trump \\\"has been helpful in opening some doors\\\"</div><p>In 2007, Tevfik told Real Estate Weekly that his success stems from surrounding himself with the right people.

The most prestigious of these was the development of the 440 million USD Trump SoHo, a 46-floor &ldquo;condominium hotel&rdquo; in the wealthy district of Lower Manhattan in New York, completed in 2010.

One of the companies in the Trump-Bayrock consortium was the Sapir Organization, owned by Georgian property developer Sapir Tamir, known as the &ldquo;Billionaire Cabbie&rdquo;.</p><p>Sapir emigrated to New York from the Soviet Union in the mid-1970s, where he took a job driving a taxi. He wouldn't drive a cab for long.</p><p>In 1977, Sapir opened an electronics business on Broadway. The shop is said to have thrived because of the Russian mob connections and KGB endorsements facilitated by his business partner, Sam Kislin - the commodoites broker who helped the Reubens get a foothold in the natural resources industry.

Even though my father is a successful entrepreneur in his own right (hotels, construction and real estate), his younger brother Refik Arif is the principal figure in the main family business (commodities),&rdquo; he adds.</p><p>&ldquo;Refik has a solid reputation (He has never been in any media or accused of any wrong-doing). My father is the more public figure due to his involvement in high publicity businesses such as hospitality and real estate with Donald Trump.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"An internal Doyen memo explaing part of the company structure (Creative commons, EIC)\\\" height=\\\"519\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Relationship%20between%20Doyen%20entities.png\\\" width=\\\"882\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Managing the images of Beckham, Bolt and Becker</div><p>The most&nbsp;public aspect&nbsp;of the new enterprise is&nbsp;the London-based sports investment and management firm, Doyen Sports, opened with a 19 million USD&nbsp;loan from Refik. It was to be the younger Arif&rsquo;s first shot at running a family business.</p><p>Doyen Sports quickly began to acquire a roster of sports personalities like David Beckham, Usain Bolt and Boris Becker. But its principal interest was football and Third-Party-Ownership (TPO) of players, including Barcelona superstars, Neymar and Xavi Hernandez, and Monaco's Radamel&nbsp;Falcao.</p><p>If the young Arif&nbsp;brought the money, it was Doyen Sports's new CEO, Nelio Lucas, who provided the credability. Lucas is a Portuguese businessman who started his own football operation from the beginning of the 2000s, while still in his early twenties. He is said to have learned his craft from working for Israeli super-agent, Pini Zahavi.</p><p>But the old family ways were hard to shake off. EIC's investigation reveals that the Arifs' sports operation used offshore slush funds to pay millions in suspicious 'commissions', and Nelio and Arif tried to <a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1276&amp;recType=story\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">bribe the Real Madrid president into purchaing one of their players,</a> using booze and prostitutes at the Arif family mansion in Miami.</p><p>It was all part of a jet-set lifestyle of girls, parties and keeping a clenched fist on their cash. Despite being a resident in London and running a multi-million-pound investment firm, Arif Arif officially only received a paltry 1,000 GBP monthly salary from Doyen. He also lived rent-free in&nbsp;Refik&rsquo;s 20 million GBP property located at Carlyle Square in the exclusive Chelsea area of west London.</p><p>Bought by Refik in 2009, the family went to great lengths to hide the ownership and avoid UK taxes.</p><p>Emails in the Football leaks trove show that in 2014 Refik and Doyen arrange to transfer the mansion's owership from a BVI company to something called the &ldquo;Carlyle Trust&rdquo; in Guernsey.</p><p>Correspondence reveals that the shift was designed to save millions in inheritance taxes &ldquo;in case Refik dies&rdquo;, but also circumvent newly enacted HMRC tax rules on UK properties nestled in offshore companies. Specifically, the UK Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (ATED), capital gains and the ten-year anniversary tax. Over ten years, thid could have deprived the UK treasury of millions in revenue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"I mean no exact tariff for the bribing&rdquo;</div><p>Doyen's main operations in Turkey run through two organisations, GGK &#7880;&#1195; Ve Dis Ticaret Limited Sirketi and TGG Construction. TGG Construction is a property development company set up in 2011 and located northeast of the &#350;i&#351;li&nbsp;district in Istanbul. It forms part of the co-dependent construction network of Sembol and Rixos, and lists many of the group&rsquo;s prestigious contracts on its website.</p><p>Guney Ikiz, former vice-chairman of Sembol and Rixos and manager of the companies&rsquo; Libya operations, was selected to run TGG, and the company's emails provide an insight into the group's blas&eacute; attitude towards paying bribes.</p><p>During discussions with&nbsp;Tevfik and Arif over the construction of a luxury condominium on Kunaev Street in Almaty, Kazakhstan, Guney writes, &ldquo;Re the cost of the permits, as you would see in the Contract, we couldn&rsquo;t specify the additional cost to obtain the permits. Because [Ali] Savc&#305; [Turkish real estate agent in Bursa, Turkey] can&rsquo;t say exactly how much we need to pay. I mean no exact tariff for the bribing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is a very delicate issue,&rdquo; Ikiz adds, &ldquo;as we communicated with A Savc&#305;, he doesn&rsquo;t want to pay on behalf of the Owner. He will tell us whom to pay.&rdquo;</p><p>No one in Doyen appeared to object&nbsp;to the payment of this &ldquo;bribe&rdquo;.</p><p>A few kilometres west of the TGG offices, near Taksim Square, is GGK &ndash; &ldquo;Gubre Gida Kimya&rdquo;, known as Fertilizer Food Chemistry in English. GGK was established to invest in fertilizer products, mainly in Iran &ndash; but quickly emerged as a conduit for&nbsp;Doyen sectors, including coal, oil and uranium, such as&nbsp;the office which manages the family's 6.5 per cent&nbsp;share in Anatolia Energy - and the Temrezli Uranium Project - through the BVI company, Blenham Ventures.</p><p>In 2012, Doyen hired a London-based, former Barclays Capital banker called Timucin Kaan as head of GGK. Kaan agreed to take the position for a 240,000 GBP salary and 180,000 GBP sign-up fee, but only if Doyen agreed to alter the tems of his contract to ensure he paid less in taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;With this agreement I get taxed on everything I receive in Turkey,&rdquo; he complains. &ldquo;As you will remember, I mentioned from day 1 that this is an issue for me. We have discussed several solutions with Elchin Bey [Tevfik&rsquo;s son-in-law]. One is to include GBP5,000 / month as my monthly salary in the written agreement where I can receive the balance offshore or privately. I have trust in the Group that if a portion of salary payment is only on a verbal agreement, this will be honoured.&rdquo;</p><p>In a later email, he asks Arif Arif&rsquo;s personal assistant and Doyen&rsquo;s in-house lawyer to help &ldquo;Set-up for tax efficient sign-up and salary payments.&rdquo; [sic]</p><p>Timucin Kaan did not respond to The Black Sea&rsquo;s questions about his tax affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">A forty-six million dollar \\\"gift\\\"</div><p>After Kaan&rsquo;s arrival, GGK purchased energy group&nbsp;Kamelot Enerji for 12.1 million USD, using a substantial cash input from Refik through his holding company Castello Ltd and the family&rsquo;s Ravana Foundation. Kamelot intended to import thousands of tonnes of Russian and American coal for sale&nbsp;on the Turkish market.</p><p>Rather than purchasing the coal directly, however, the Arifs used their Panama company, Doyen Natural Resources (DNR), as a conduit for the transaction. Documents show that DNR bought the coal for around 180 USD per tonne, and then traded&nbsp;to Kamelot for ten USD&nbsp;more. It&rsquo;s not clear for how much Doyen then sold the shipments, but Kamelot&rsquo;s financial records for 2014 and 2015 show only millions in losses - and they never paid&nbsp;any taxes in Turkey.</p><p>Yet&nbsp;Kamelot continued to buy and sell coal, sending millions to DNR each month. DNR's Credit Suisse statements show&nbsp;millions being paid into the family&rsquo;s trusts, including the one in Guernsey which owns the London mansion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"We need to liquidate the company ASAP\\\"</div><p>In 2012, the Arifs had invested alongside the Kazakh trio from ENRC (led by Alexander Maskkevitch)&nbsp;in Zamin Ferrous, a mining company owned by Indian businessman Pramod Agarwal with iron ore contracts in Brazil.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, the group became embroiled in a long-running legal disputes over money, including sums owed to Doyen for its initial 50 million-dollar&nbsp;investment.</p><p>Therefore in the summer of 2014, Doyen needed to liquidate DNR. They were concerned about Panama&rsquo;s poor reputation with western banks, and a potential UK tax liability.</p><p>The iron and coal business would be moved into a new Panama company called Prime Natural Resources. But before that can happen, Doyen mist find a way to disappear over four million dollars it owes to DNR for the coal, without raising suspicions&nbsp;of fraud with the liquidator in Panama.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to liquidate DNR as quickly as possible,&rdquo; internal documents reveal, &ldquo;to remove any possibility that the UK tax authorities claim that any profits from DNR should be assessed in the UK because the Zamin contracts are essentially being performed from the UK office, and because we need to show to the banks that the new structure is fully set up with the Zamin contracts being an integral part of that setup.&rdquo;</p><p>If Kamelot kept the cash, it would \\\"in all likelihood be liable for Turkish tax,\\\" says Amro Sinjab, Business Development Associate at Doyen Capital in London.</p><p>As other deals show, taxes are only minimally tolerated by the Arifs.</p><p>Doyen Chief Financial Officer, Nitesh Shah, suggests moving the cash to the Arifs&rsquo; Guernsey-based company, Eristavi, owned by Arif Arif's Lomisa Trust.</p><p>Shah writes to Rupert Worsdale, a tax expert with Luxemburg advisory and investment firm, Maitland Group, who assisted Doyen and GGK during the original purchase of Kamelot.</p><p>&ldquo;Whilst [the move to Eristavi] may seem straight forward at first,&rdquo; writes Shah, &ldquo;there is a possibility that this debt may not be repaid for a long time, and maybe never. The debt would sit in Eristavi interest free, and would be brought in as another gift either directly into Eristavi, or through the trust. Your thoughts would be appreciated.&rdquo;</p><p>Worsdale agrees to help. According to emails between Amro and Shah the tax lawyer advised that &ldquo;the best option would be to shift it to Eristavi as a Contribution to Capital.&nbsp;There would be no need for&nbsp;interest to be chargeable on this and the &lsquo;debt&rsquo; can sit in Eristavi's books until Kamelot pays it back.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Lomisa%20gift.PNG\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; width: 600px; height: 461px;\\\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In September 2014, DNR begins gifting money to Lomisa &ndash; which disappears into the Doyen black hole of cash. Kamelot continued to trade with a new Panama company, Prime Natural Resources.</p><p>But it was not the only cash to make its way from DNR to Lomisa. A letter dated month earlier shows DNR &ldquo;gifted an additional amount of USD $41,100,000.00 (forty one million one hundred thousand US dollars) to Lomisa Trust.&nbsp; This brings \\\"the total amount gifted to the Trust to $46.1m&rdquo;.</p><p>Like DNR's coal revenues, these millions went to increasing Eristavi's share capital in low-tax Guernsey.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Doyen is dead. Long live Doyen</div><p>Another reason to flee from the Doyan name&nbsp;might have had something to do with a troublesome Bloomberg article published a year earlier. On 2 July, 2013, Bloomberg reporter, Alex Duff, published a piece about the &ldquo;Kazakh Family&rdquo; backers of Doyen Sport's questionable football operation.</p><p>Although the substance of the story was relatively innocuous, it seems that mention of the Arif family, the Savarona yacht and Kazakh connections, was enough to force the family into a frenzy.</p><p>The story was&nbsp;apparently enough to persuade the Arifs to close the UK business and recolate to a tax-friendlier Dubai under the name Doyen Meten. At least on paper. Journalists recently visiting Doyen&rsquo;s London office witnessed a fully staffed operation, with the company plaque still on the door.&nbsp;</p><p>The day after the story was published, Arif Arif complained to Rod Christie-Miller, Chief Executive &amp; Partner at&nbsp;Schillings, a London law firm specialising in defamation and privacy. In the months and years after the Savarona affair, the Arifs employed the servcies of the British privacy law firm, Schillings, and Bell Pottinger, the London PR company famous for scrubbling online criticism of despotic regimes, to remove news stories linking the family to the yacht scandal.</p><p>&ldquo;We don't like fame Rod, and [the journalist] does mention the yacht incident&hellip;&rdquo; Arif Arif wrote.</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know what could be done. In my eyes this isn't a positive article nor does it want to promote us in any way. I view it as attack on our business through using past incidents to add spice to the whole picture. Third-party ownership is looked down upon by animals like [Alex] Duff, because they simply don't understand the business and no one gives them the time of day to explain it. For this reason he slams it.&rdquo;</p><p>Internal communications give a glimpse into why the Arifs&rsquo; are so publicity averse:&nbsp;their relationship with Mashkevich and his &ldquo;friends&rdquo;.</p><p>Following the Savarona affair, relations between Tevfik and the Kazakhs became strained. &ldquo;Mashkevich didn't want nothing to do with us,&rdquo; Arif Arif explained to his sister, Ayla. &ldquo;He blamed dad for everything to cover his own ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;BUT, &ldquo;Ayla responded. &ldquo;On the otherhand, he also is helping dad keep hold of his primary business&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;And he's a great friend for that,&rdquo; Arif said. &ldquo;But he wants to see dad doing good but not better than him.&rdquo;</p><p>When the Bloomberg piece was then picked up by Tukish media, Arif complained again, this time to Nelio Lucas.</p><p>&ldquo;They are bringing up the yacht, the relationship to the PM [Erdo&#287;an], everything,&rdquo; Arif wrote.</p><p>&ldquo;Doyen brand is dead bro. I have to distance myself and the trading from it&hellip;&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Lawyers told [me] &lsquo;now that your father has been identified as a key backer, the [Doyen] name is infected'&rdquo; he added.</p><p>When Nelio reassured Arif that the Bloomberg piece was &ldquo;not that bad&rdquo;, the heir-apparent scolded his friend, reminding him that he had always lived in the civilised world, and could not understand the power of the Kazakhs to interfere with the family&rsquo;s money machine.</p><p>&ldquo;The most important is the kazakhstan issue. [We] Cant let word get out there otherwise we face very big problems.&rdquo; [sic]</p><p>&ldquo;[You] must explain to me,&rdquo; Nelio answers.</p><p>&ldquo;Get it through your head it's not funny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;[The Kazakh&rsquo;s] will ruin us. They will expose us, our businesses and our high level relationships then it's all over.&rdquo;</p><p>The &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; Turkish relationships the Arifs were desperate to protect include several businessmen close to the President.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Meet the President</div></div><p><strong>The Arifs became partners with Turkish President Erdogan's childhood friend, Sitki Ayan, on a failed Iran-Turkey-Europe gas pipeline</strong></p><p><strong>This partnership now includes futher multi-billion deals backed by Erdogan, including exclusive contracts to sell natural gas and electricity from Iran and Turkmenistan</strong></p><p><strong>Arifs discussed paying millions to get Real Madrid to perform for Turkmenistan president in the hope this&nbsp;would facilitate the energy deal.</strong></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><p>Even though the Savarona yacht&nbsp;prostitution scandal supplied an abundance of unwanted attention in Turkey, where citizens are mostly&nbsp;conservative and Muslim, it seems it did not&nbsp;dampen the Arifs' appeal to the country's privileged elite, including those within President Erdogan&rsquo;s inner circle.</p><p>It certainly didn't sway Ali Demirhan, stalwart of President Recep Tayyip Erdo&#287;an's Justice and Development Party, known as the AKP, when he became Doyen's new legal advisor in 2012. Demirhan is a Turkish lawyer and chairman of his own construction and tourism company, Mirhan Holdings.</p><p>He is described inside Doyen as a &ldquo;close friend and partner&rdquo; of the Arifs. According to his own bio, Demirhan &ldquo;was born in 1976 in Istanbul; he is married and has 3 children. He has a BA in Law from Istanbul University.&rdquo;</p><p>He is also reputedly a good friend and supporter of Erdogan: &ldquo;For the past 30 years Mr Demirhan&rsquo;s family has been supporting the political career of Prime Minister Erdo&#287;an,&rdquo; the biography stated.&nbsp;A few years ago he unsuccessfully ran as an MP&nbsp;for the AKP.</p><p>Demirhan became useful almost immediately, during a&nbsp;scandal <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF9mxlp-OH8\\\">involving Sarah Ferguson</a>, Britain's&nbsp;Duchess of York and former wife of Prince Andrew, brother of&nbsp;the heir to the British throne.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"An arrest warrant for Fergie\\\"</div><p>In 2008, the Duchess took part in an undercover documentary on the shabby state of Turkey&rsquo;s orphanages. In the film,&nbsp;disabled chidren were left in their own excrement and one, who was never let outside, had to lay in a corridor close to a&nbsp;window to feel the sunlight on his face.</p><p>The film prompted Turkey's&nbsp;Social Security and Child Services Authority and the Ministry of Family Affairs to lodge a criminal complaint against Ferguson&nbsp;for entering the country under false pretences, and claimed&nbsp;she was part of a &ldquo;smearing campaign against Turkey by [those] opposing Turkey&rsquo;s EU membership.&rdquo;</p><p>The Ministry of Justice even issued an international arrest warrant.</p><p>The Duchess turned to her friend in London, Arif Arif, and Demirhan, to defuse the crisis. Doyen drafted an apology letter for Ferguson addressed to Prime Minister Erdo&#287;an explaining the misunderstanding. It is not clear if the letter was ever delivered, but the charges against Ferguson were eventually dropped.</p><p>Aside from a little PR for former royals, Demirhan assisted Doyen in exploring education and gold deals in Turkey. But he also opened doors for Doyen.</p><p>On a chilly Istanbul evening in the beginning of March 2012, Demirhan introduced Doyen Capital's vice president, Tevfik Eren to Turkey&rsquo;s answer to Donald Trump: Ali Agaoglu &ndash; a real estate magnate close to Erdo&#287;an. Agaoglu has in the past been accused of donating millions to Turgev, the education&nbsp;foundation of Bilal Erdo&#287;an, the president&rsquo;s son, in return for public contracts.</p><p>After a dinner at the up-market Maisa restaurant in Istanbul's bankside neighbourhood &#304;stinye, the trio travelled to Fiyapi Inonu stadium, home of Be&#351;ikta&#351; football club, to watch the team play local side Trabzon. Here, Eren made some important contacts.</p><p>&ldquo;In the half time,&rdquo; Eren writes, &ldquo;Ali [Demirhan] introduced me to Mr Sadik Albayrak and Mr Murat Ulgen, CEO of [Be&#351;ikta&#351;]. Mr Sadik Albayrak is the father of Mr Berat Albayrak, CEO of &Ccedil;al&#305;k Holding, who is also the son-in-law of Mr Recep Tayyip Erdo&#287;an.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Both conversations were short and welcoming,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Ali mentioned briefly about our presence in UK and told that he&rsquo;d introduce me to Mr Berat Albayrak, in order to pursue potential synergies that we might achieve together.&rdquo;</p><p>A&#287;ao&#287;lu arranged meetings for the following day with several other prominent figures, including AKP MP&nbsp;Mikail Arslan, Guney Ikiz, who became head of TGG Construction a year later,&nbsp;Hakan Ferhato&#287;lu, chairman of Ata Invest &amp; board member of construction company, and Yuksel Insaat, involved in the 6.3 billion USD&nbsp;Istanbul-Izmir Highway project.</p><p>It appears that the introductions bore fruit for the ambitious Arif enterprise. Doyen would soon be involved in Turkmenistan energy deals with &Ccedil;al&#305;k Holding.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Enter the king of petrol who calls the President \\\"by his first name\\\"</div><p>The energy deals appear to be facilitated by another prominent business connection: Sitki Ayan, chairman of energy trading firm ASB Group and childhood friend of President Erdo&#287;an. Ayan and Erdogan are close. So close that Ayan calls the president by his first name in public and occasionally joins the him on official trips abroad.</p><p>In July 2010, Ayan and the state-owned Iranian National Gas Company declared that Som Petrol, a subsidiary of ASB Group, Ayan&rsquo;s main enterprise, had been awarded a billion Euro contract to help build the &lsquo;Persian pipeline&rsquo; &ndash; a huge, four-year infrastructure project to transport 35 billion cubic metres of natural gas from Iran to the EU, though Turkey.</p><p>The &lsquo;Persian pipeline&rsquo; - or Iran-Turkey-Europe pipeline (ITE) - deal was forged amid increased international pressure to enforce sanctions against the Iranian government over the West&rsquo;s fears of nuclear proliferation.</p><p>Seemingly, the announcement by Ayan and Iranian officials came as a shock to some. Almost immediately, Turkish energy minister, Taner Yildiz, publicly rejected Ayan&rsquo;s claims, declaring that neither the government nor Turkey&rsquo;s Petroleum Pipeline Corporation, BOTA&#350;, had determined who would receive the contract on the Turkish side.</p><p>But Ayan&rsquo;s confidence was not exactly misplaced. Despite ASB Group and SOM seen largely as trading companies, with no experience in infrastructure projects of this size, Erdo&#287;an&rsquo;s cabinet approved the pipeline deal in August &ndash; as Tevfik and his Kazakh friends were preparing their adventures on Ataturk&rsquo;s yacht &ndash; naming SOM Petrol subsidiary, Turang Transit Tasimacilik, as the licensee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Sitki%2C%20Arif%2C%20Agreement.PNG\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 598px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin-right: 5px; margin-left: 5px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A year later, in the autumn of 2011, months after Tevfik was acquitted of the trafficking charges by a Turkish court, the Arifs and Ayan struck a deal for the Iranian gas.</p><p>The Arifs controlled 50 per cent&nbsp;of the new venture, Somas Enerji, which held the rights to sell the gas in Turkey, through ASTU Do&#287;algaz Enerji Ticaret Ltd.,&nbsp;jointly owned by Refik Arif and Malik Ali.</p><p>The Arifs' role was unsurprising, given their background. According to agreements found in the Football Leaks data, they will &ldquo;exclusively manage and conduct negotiations with gas suppliers from the former Soviet Union countries such as Turkmenistan, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan etc,&rdquo; &ndash; in return for 20 per cent of any profits.</p><p>Ayan and his son Bahaddin Ayan&nbsp;would have been&nbsp;tasked with lobbying the &ldquo;Iran government regarding transportation/transit of the natural gas to be transferred to Turkey and/or UAE&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"Bring Barca or Real to Turkmenistan to impress the President\\\"</div><p>The Arifs were true to their word apparently. In May 2012, Turkmenistan Energy Minister Bairamgeldy Nedirov invited Sitki Ayan to a meeting in the capital Ashgabat to discuss electricity exports. Sitki graciously agrees to attend along with &ldquo;Mr. Tevfik Arif, and Mr. Hamid Farzam, as Advisor to Deputy Energy Minister to Iran. [sic]&rdquo;</p><p>At the time, Arif Arif told Nelio Lucas that Doyen was \\\"on the verge of something big in Turkmenistan. This will be Skips masterpiece.\\\"</p><p>As a greaser, he suggested that they \\\"bring either Real Madrid or Barca there to play an exhibition match to impress the president. There are billions to be made there. I need you to take this very serious and start planning asap please&rdquo; [sic].</p><p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Nelio answered, &ldquo;President of Real [Madrid] is in London today. I fly with him to Madrid. A few days later, Nelio updates Arif. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple. 3m &euro; Minimum, and they need to have a date.&rdquo;</p><p>Ultimately, the money never showed up. But the willingness of the family to exploit its football connections was hampered only by a reluctance to part with three million Euro. So&nbsp;Real Madrid escaped having to grandstand for Turkmenistan&rsquo;s autocratic leader, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, in the service of the Arifs&rsquo; business interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Application%2C%20Sitki%2C%20Refik.PNG\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 439px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But whatever else happened behind the scenes appears to have worked. The following year, the Turkmenenergo State Power Corporation of the Ministry of Energy in Turkmenistan awarded Ayan&rsquo;s company, Gent, the rights to sell electricity to Turkey through Iran.</p><p>The Arifs were placed firmly in the centre of deal.</p><p>Through its holding in ASTU Dogalgaz Enerji, the family owned 50 per cent&nbsp;of ASKA Energy, the company set to sell the electricity on the Turkish market. It took only a month for ASKA to obtain its licence from Turkey&rsquo;s Energy Market Management Authority (EPDK).

Experts believe that the Som Petrol deal was permitted by the Turkish government to soothe Washington&rsquo;s concerns over a similar project agreed in 2007 between Iran and the state-owned Turkish National Oil Co, which skirted close to violating sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the truth, the Turkish state appeared keen to reward Ayan and his troupe for their failures. On 16 December 2013, the government announced 3.3bn Euro in &ldquo;incentives&rdquo; - customs tax exemptions, tax discounts and social security support &ndash; to Turang Transit for transporting &ldquo;natural gas through pipeline&rdquo;. It was at the time the second highest &ldquo;incentive&rdquo; package ever awarded in Turkey - the highest being awarded to &Ccedil;al&#305;k Holdings &ndash; whose CEO was Berat Albayrak &ndash; for the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline project.</p><p>The following day, Erdo&#287;an&rsquo;s government was hit by a massive corruption scandal, as police arrested over 50 people with links to the AKP - including MPs and members of their families, and businessmen, like Ali A&#287;ao&#287;lu - implicated in a catalogue of financial misdeeds.</p><p>In the end 14 were officially charged with a range of crimes, including bribery, fraud, money laundering and smuggling gold.</p><p>The accusations related to the Turkey&rsquo;s gas deal with Iran. The Iran government was at the time still under international sanctions over its alleged nuclear programme. But Turkey had found a loophole: gold.&nbsp;Sanctions permitted the exporting of gold out of Turkey.</p><p>A scheme was engineered to pay for the gas and oil in Turkish Lira using an account at the county's Halkbank. With over ten billion dollars in revenue, the Iranians purchase gold bullion, which was shipped to Iran though the UAE.</p><p>A week later, the crisis intensified as tapes emerged of conversations between Erdo&#287;an and his son, Bilal, appearing to discuss bribes from Ayan.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. S&#305;tk&#305; came yesterday saying he couldn&rsquo;t do the transfer properly,&rdquo; Bilal says. But &ldquo;that he currently has about 10 or so (million dollars), [and] that he can give it whenever we want&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;No no,&rdquo; Erdo&#287;an replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take it&hellip; If he&rsquo;s going to bring what he promised, then let him bring it. If not, then no need. Others can bring it, so why can&rsquo;t he, huh? &hellip; But they are falling now, they&rsquo;ll fall on our laps, don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo;</p><p>Erdo&#287;an denied the authenticity of the recordings, but many in Turkey believe the conversations related to energy deal &ldquo;incentives&rdquo; announced the day before the arrests.</p><p>Ultimately, the AKP government sabotaged the corruption investigation. But if Erdo&#287;an ever thought to distance himself from Ayan and the scandal or mitigate accusations of political nepotism and corruption, he didn&rsquo;t show it.

Rixos has 20 hotels across the world, mostly in Turkey, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Russia and UAE, and boasts an annual revenue of around half a billion euro.</p><p>Sembol is even bigger. Now one of&nbsp;Turkey&rsquo;s leading construction companies, its turnover is estimated at nearly 1.5 billion dollars, mostly earned through public contracts in Kazakhstan. A presidential library, universities, a train station, mosques, luxury business and sports centres, four Rixos&nbsp;hotels. Sembol built them all. And more.</p><p>In Turkey, in addition to Rixos&rsquo;s ten establishments, it received&nbsp;multi-million dollar contracts for the Istanbul Congress Centre and Zigina Tunnel on the Black Sea coast.</p><p>In 2010, the Russian Olympics Committee awarded Sembol around one billion USD&nbsp;in contracts for the Sochi games, including for a Rixos Hotel.

Here are the Rixos documents signed between Fettah and your dad&rdquo; are a series of legal documents from 2006: a &lsquo;Declaration &amp; Undertaking&rsquo; and &lsquo;Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)&rsquo; &ndash; each signed by both Tamince and Tevfik &ndash; and a copy of the Rixos&rsquo;s company structure.</p><p>The declaration, dated August 2006, discusses restructuring Rixos and Sembol entities in the British Virgin Islands. It states that Tamince holds shares in six companies, including Rixos, Sembol, and four others related to the hotel chain, on Arif&rsquo;s behalf.</p><p>&ldquo;While the Shares are officially registered under the direct or indirect ownership of me, my family and other companies of which we are shareholders,&rdquo; Tamince attests, &ldquo;Tevfik Arif is the actual, beneficial owner&rdquo; of 50 per cent&nbsp;of these Sembol and Rixos shares.</p><p>&ldquo;The reason the Arif Shares are registered to my name,&rdquo; the declaration continues, &ldquo;is the confidential relationship between me and Tevfik Arif and that the intent is, was and has always been that I would hold the Arif Shares in trust on behalf of Tevfik Arif.&rdquo;</p><p>The accompanying MoU decrees that a new committee be established to decide on investments.</p><p>Among the five men listed to take a seat on the commission, which includes Tevfik and Tamince, are Rixos vice president and Turkish lawyer, Mutlu Simayli, and Eugene Jaffe of Salford Capital Partners. Salford is an investment firm operating out of London at the time and reputedly owned by deceased oligarchs, Badri Patarkatsishvili, from Georgia, and Russian, Boris Berezovsky, both key players in the 1990s aluminium wars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><span style=\\\"color: rgb(116, 192, 226); font-weight: bold;\\\">The Berezovsky Link</span></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Berezovsky%20Loan.PNG\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 388px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\\\"></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><p>Incidentally, in 2010 and 2011, the Arifs generously provided Berezovsky &ndash; under his new name Platon Elenin - with two unsecured loans totalling 6.5 million GBP&nbsp;(around eight&nbsp;million Euro) to &ldquo;help with his personal expenses&rdquo;. The loan, which was supposed to be repaid within 20 days, remained outstanding at the time of the exiled Russian&rsquo;s mysterious&nbsp;death&nbsp;in 2013.</p><p>Berezovky spent much of his past few years locked in an ill-fated legal battle with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who he unsuccessfully argued had robbed him of billions of dollars in shares, including in Rusal - Abramovich's aluminium operation that subsumed the Chernoy's business. &nbsp;</p><p>Tamince and Arif have been partners since at least 1999, when Tevfik invested three million dollars in the Labada project - a five-star, all-inclusive hotel&nbsp;on the coast of Antalya, Turkey.</p><p>At that time Tamince was already a respectable entrepreneur, famous for escaping his humble beginnings as a teenage carpet seller and establishing himself as a successful jeweller. The Labada was one of his first moves into Turkey&rsquo;s lucrative tourism industry, and Rixos and Sembol were established to complete the construction.</p><p>The same year, Tamince and Tevfik started an import-export enterprise, Sardes Mucevherat Ticaret AS, importing luxury jewellery to Turkey. It was later accused of falsifying invoices to avoid taxes &ndash; a charge Tamince denies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">The Ukrainian connection</div><p>On the Rixos board is Ukrainian, Igor Gumenyuk, an associate of Rinat Akhmetov, owner of Shaktar Donetsk football team and one of Ukraine&rsquo;s richest men. For two decades, Akhmetov has used the legal system to fend off allegations that his wealth is the result of early associations with organised crime. &nbsp;</p><p>The Arifs are, too, connected to Ukraine. Sembol has three completed projects in Ukraine: the Victoria Hotel, the Metallurg Hotel Complex, and the &ldquo;Donetsk City&rdquo; shopping centre, a huge construction contract in which they partnered with Igor Gumenyuk.</p><p>The photograph of Arif Arif with President Erdo&#287;an (below) was taken at the 9th Yalta conference in Ukraine on 14 September 2012, organised by oligarch Viktor Pinchuk.

In 2004, when G&uuml;len and Erdo&#287;an were on tentatively friendly terms, Tamince told Turkish media that he considered the cleric an &ldquo;idol&rdquo;. Later, when he became wealthy, he gave money to the group.</p><p>Tamince would cut ties with the organisation in 2013, when G&uuml;len and Erdo&#287;an engaged in open conflict for control of Turkey&rsquo;s institutions, declaring that he had been tricked by G&uuml;len and that he was &ldquo;in love with Erdo&#287;an&rdquo;.</p><p>The power of the G&uuml;len movement in Turkey extends to the&nbsp;judiciary and law enforcement institutions. This might explain how Tamince may have&nbsp;cautioned Tevfik in April 2010 that police were tapping the phones of many of his employees, trying to gather evidence&nbsp;about sex trafficking [an accusation which Tamince denies].</p><p>According to the Savarona indictment transcript, on 27 April, 'Uncle' Gunduz - Gunduz Akdeniz, a man close to Tevfik who was involved in the Sardes jewellery company -&nbsp; calls Tevfik with a warning: &ldquo;Two or three days ago, Fettah Bey came to Istanbul, talked to Vakyf [Vakif Arif] Bey, told [him] man-to-man&rdquo; about the surveillance, apparently active for &ldquo;about a year or two already.&rdquo; A lawyer involved in the case confirmed that &lsquo;Fettah Bey&rsquo; is Fettah Tamince.</p><p>In response to questions by The Black Sea, Tamince said, &ldquo;I have no relationship or contact with the after mentioned person G&uuml;nd&uuml;z Akdeniz.&rdquo; [sic]</p><p>He also denied any involvement with Tevfik Arif, saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any partnership with Tevfik Arif. At the companies I am shareholder of, Tevfik Arif doesn&rsquo;t have any shares or any partnership.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also denied interfering in the Savarona investigation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Bayrock: \\\"Mail, wire, and bank fraud,&nbsp;tax evasion,&nbsp;money laundering,&nbsp;conspiracy,&nbsp;bribery,&nbsp;extortion,&nbsp;embezzlement&rdquo;</div><p>The same year that Tevfik and Tamince created a hotel and construction operation in Turkey, the Arifs established the beginnings of their property enterprise in the United States.</p><p>The offices of the new venture, named Bayrock Capital, were housed in the Trump Towers on New York&rsquo;s exclusive Fifth Avenue. Tevfik was seemingly impressed with the future president, even sending Arif Arif to the same New York military academy Trump attended in the early 1960s.</p><p>Tevfik appointed Burak Yenero&#287;lu as president of Bayrock. Yenero&#287;lu, who lives in a mansion opposite Tevfik in Miami, is closely associated with the Turkic-American Alliance, a known G&uuml;lenist organisation. According to filings, Yenero&#287;lu raised 652,000 USD for Obama's re-election campaign.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Burak Yenero&#287;lu with President Obama (Credit: White House)\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/95893-obama-nin-zaferinin-arkasindaki-turkler.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 290px;\\\"></p><p>Working alongside Yenero&#287;lu was Bayrock&rsquo;s new managing director, Russian-born former Wall Street stockbroker and convicted felon, Felix Sater.</p><p>Like many of the Arifs&rsquo; associates, Sater&rsquo;s history is colourful. In 1991, he stabbed a fellow broker in the face with a glass during an argument in a New York bar and spent a year in jail.</p><p>According to U.S. <a href=\\\"http://licensedtolie.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Palmer-Petition-for-a-writ-of-certiorari-14-676.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Supreme Court documents</a>, upon his release Sater embarked on a &ldquo;&lsquo;pump-and-dump&rsquo; penny stock fraud in partnership with \\\"Russian and La Cosa Nostra career criminals.\\\" The mafia scam involved inflating the prices of near-worthless company shares before offloading them for massive profit, &ldquo;bilking investors of at least $40,000,000&rdquo; in the process. It would lead to his second conviction &ndash; this time for securities fraud and racketeering &ndash; in 1998. &nbsp;</p><p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the end of Sater. Following his conviction, he cut a confidential witness deal with the FBI and the New York United States Attorney's Office of Loretta Lynch &ndash; now Attorney General. He agreed to spy on his Russian mafia friends in return for keeping his convictions secret from banks and investors during development projects.</p><p>This pact, says the Supreme Court petition, &ldquo;facilitated&rdquo; Sater&rsquo;s effort to &ldquo;commit a billion dollars of continuing predicate crime during the ten years following his conviction&rdquo; - the same period he headed Bayrock. Incidentally, in the mid-2000s he was appointed as a senior advisor to Rixos and Sembol, a position&nbsp;he still holds. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sater&rsquo;s criminal career was of little concern to the Arifs as Bayrock grew rapidly in the property market worldwide, using its hidden connection to Rixos and Sembol to boast to investors about real estate transactions &ldquo;valued in excess of $2.5 billion USD&rdquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Trump \\\"has been helpful in opening some doors\\\"</div><p>In 2007, Tevfik told Real Estate Weekly that his success stems from surrounding himself with the right people. One of these is Donald Trump, due to be inaugurated as the President of the United States next month. &ldquo;He's been very helpful to us from the beginning and he's been very helpful in opening some doors,&rdquo; Tevfik stated in the interview.</p><p>&ldquo;The strength of the relationship is: we do what we do best&ndash;and we're very active in what we do&ndash;and Trump does what he does best.&rdquo;</p><p>It was in 2005 that Bayrock and Trump began working on projects together. The most prestigious of these was the development of the 440 million USD Trump SoHo, a 46-floor &ldquo;condominium hotel&rdquo; in the wealthy district of Lower Manhattan in New York, completed in 2010. Many of the complex&rsquo;s residents are said to come from the Russian underworld.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Trump Soho (Creative Commons, EIC) \\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Trump%20SoHo_BW.png\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 449px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is unsurprising, given the project&rsquo;s partners. One of the companies in the Trump-Bayrock consortium was the Sapir Organization, owned by Georgian property developer Sapir Tamir, known as the &ldquo;Billionaire Cabbie&rdquo;.</p><p>Sapir emigrated to New York from the Soviet Union in the mid-1970s, where he took a job driving a taxi. He wouldn't drive a cab for long.</p><p>In 1977, Sapir opened an electronics business on Broadway. The shop is said to have thrived because of the Russian mob connections and KGB endorsements facilitated by his business partner, Sam Kislin - the commodoites broker who helped the Reubens get a foothold in the natural resources industry. Sapir later moved into real estate, and by the time of his death in 2014, he was worth 1.4 billion USD, much of this in New York property.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"Threats of torture and death\\\"</div><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before Bayrock ran into legal troubles. In 2009, Jody Kriss, former Bayrock finance officer, who admitted he knew of the company's links to the Russian mafia, filed a lawsuit against the Bayrock, Tevfik, Sapir and Sater. Kriss alleged that Bayrock was little more than a mob operation, embezzling millions of dollars, defrauding the Internal Revenue Service and extorting money through <a href=\\\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2638421/Kriss-v-Bayrock-Complaint.txt\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">threats of torture and death.</a></p><p>Tevfik was accused of running Bayrock as a &ldquo;mere conduit hiding the source&rdquo; of its money - the family&rsquo;s chrome refinery in Kazakhstan - and pilfering millions in dodgy loans.

He is said to have learned his craft from working for Israeli super-agent, Pini Zahavi.</p><p>But the old family ways were hard to shake off. EIC's investigation reveals that the Arifs' sports operation used offshore slush funds to pay millions in suspicious 'commissions', and Nelio and Arif tried to <a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1276&amp;recType=story\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">bribe the Real Madrid president into purchaing one of their players,</a> using booze and prostitutes at the Arif family mansion in Miami.</p><p>It was all part of a jet-set lifestyle of girls, parties and keeping a clenched fist on their cash. Despite being a resident in London and running a multi-million-pound investment firm, Arif Arif officially only received a paltry 1,000 GBP monthly salary from Doyen. He also lived rent-free in&nbsp;Refik&rsquo;s 20 million GBP property located at Carlyle Square in the exclusive Chelsea area of west London.</p><p>Bought by Refik in 2009, the family went to great lengths to hide the ownership and avoid UK taxes.</p><p>Emails in the Football leaks trove show that in 2014 Refik and Doyen arrange to transfer the mansion's owership from a BVI company to something called the &ldquo;Carlyle Trust&rdquo; in Guernsey.</p><p>Correspondence reveals that the shift was designed to save millions in inheritance taxes &ldquo;in case Refik dies&rdquo;, but also circumvent newly enacted HMRC tax rules on UK properties nestled in offshore companies. Specifically, the UK Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (ATED), capital gains and the ten-year anniversary tax. Over ten years, thid could have deprived the UK treasury of millions in revenue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"I mean no exact tariff for the bribing&rdquo;</div><p>Doyen's main operations in Turkey run through two organisations, GGK &#7880;&#1195; Ve Dis Ticaret Limited Sirketi and TGG Construction. TGG Construction is a property development company set up in 2011 and located northeast of the &#350;i&#351;li&nbsp;district in Istanbul. It forms part of the co-dependent construction network of Sembol and Rixos, and lists many of the group&rsquo;s prestigious contracts on its website.</p><p>Guney Ikiz, former vice-chairman of Sembol and Rixos and manager of the companies&rsquo; Libya operations, was selected to run TGG, and the company's emails provide an insight into the group's blas&eacute; attitude towards paying bribes.</p><p>During discussions with&nbsp;Tevfik and Arif over the construction of a luxury condominium on Kunaev Street in Almaty, Kazakhstan, Guney writes, &ldquo;Re the cost of the permits, as you would see in the Contract, we couldn&rsquo;t specify the additional cost to obtain the permits. Because [Ali] Savc&#305; [Turkish real estate agent in Bursa, Turkey] can&rsquo;t say exactly how much we need to pay. I mean no exact tariff for the bribing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is a very delicate issue,&rdquo; Ikiz adds, &ldquo;as we communicated with A Savc&#305;, he doesn&rsquo;t want to pay on behalf of the Owner. He will tell us whom to pay.&rdquo;</p><p>No one in Doyen appeared to object&nbsp;to the payment of this &ldquo;bribe&rdquo;.</p><p>A few kilometres west of the TGG offices, near Taksim Square, is GGK &ndash; &ldquo;Gubre Gida Kimya&rdquo;, known as Fertilizer Food Chemistry in English. GGK was established to invest in fertilizer products, mainly in Iran &ndash; but quickly emerged as a conduit for&nbsp;Doyen sectors, including coal, oil and uranium, such as&nbsp;the office which manages the family's 6.5 per cent&nbsp;share in Anatolia Energy - and the Temrezli Uranium Project - through the BVI company, Blenham Ventures.</p><p>In 2012, Doyen hired a London-based, former Barclays Capital banker called Timucin Kaan as head of GGK. Kaan agreed to take the position for a 240,000 GBP salary and 180,000 GBP sign-up fee, but only if Doyen agreed to alter the tems of his contract to ensure he paid less in taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;With this agreement I get taxed on everything I receive in Turkey,&rdquo; he complains. &ldquo;As you will remember, I mentioned from day 1 that this is an issue for me. We have discussed several solutions with Elchin Bey [Tevfik&rsquo;s son-in-law]. One is to include GBP5,000 / month as my monthly salary in the written agreement where I can receive the balance offshore or privately. I have trust in the Group that if a portion of salary payment is only on a verbal agreement, this will be honoured.&rdquo;</p><p>In a later email, he asks Arif Arif&rsquo;s personal assistant and Doyen&rsquo;s in-house lawyer to help &ldquo;Set-up for tax efficient sign-up and salary payments.&rdquo; [sic]</p><p>Timucin Kaan did not respond to The Black Sea&rsquo;s questions about his tax affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">A forty-six million dollar \\\"gift\\\"</div><p>After Kaan&rsquo;s arrival, GGK purchased energy group&nbsp;Kamelot Enerji for 12.1 million USD, using a substantial cash input from Refik through his holding company Castello Ltd and the family&rsquo;s Ravana Foundation. Kamelot intended to import thousands of tonnes of Russian and American coal for sale&nbsp;on the Turkish market.</p><p>Rather than purchasing the coal directly, however, the Arifs used their Panama company, Doyen Natural Resources (DNR), as a conduit for the transaction. Documents show that DNR bought the coal for around 180 USD per tonne, and then traded&nbsp;to Kamelot for ten USD&nbsp;more. It&rsquo;s not clear for how much Doyen then sold the shipments, but Kamelot&rsquo;s financial records for 2014 and 2015 show only millions in losses - and they never paid&nbsp;any taxes in Turkey.</p><p>Yet&nbsp;Kamelot continued to buy and sell coal, sending millions to DNR each month. DNR's Credit Suisse statements show&nbsp;millions being paid into the family&rsquo;s trusts, including the one in Guernsey which owns the London mansion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"We need to liquidate the company ASAP\\\"</div><p>In 2012, the Arifs had invested alongside the Kazakh trio from ENRC (led by Alexander Maskkevitch)&nbsp;in Zamin Ferrous, a mining company owned by Indian businessman Pramod Agarwal with iron ore contracts in Brazil.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, the group became embroiled in a long-running legal disputes over money, including sums owed to Doyen for its initial 50 million-dollar&nbsp;investment.</p><p>Therefore in the summer of 2014, Doyen needed to liquidate DNR. They were concerned about Panama&rsquo;s poor reputation with western banks, and a potential UK tax liability.</p><p>The iron and coal business would be moved into a new Panama company called Prime Natural Resources. But before that can happen, Doyen mist find a way to disappear over four million dollars it owes to DNR for the coal, without raising suspicions&nbsp;of fraud with the liquidator in Panama.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to liquidate DNR as quickly as possible,&rdquo; internal documents reveal, &ldquo;to remove any possibility that the UK tax authorities claim that any profits from DNR should be assessed in the UK because the Zamin contracts are essentially being performed from the UK office, and because we need to show to the banks that the new structure is fully set up with the Zamin contracts being an integral part of that setup.&rdquo;</p><p>If Kamelot kept the cash, it would \\\"in all likelihood be liable for Turkish tax,\\\" says Amro Sinjab, Business Development Associate at Doyen Capital in London.</p><p>As other deals show, taxes are only minimally tolerated by the Arifs.</p><p>Doyen Chief Financial Officer, Nitesh Shah, suggests moving the cash to the Arifs&rsquo; Guernsey-based company, Eristavi, owned by Arif Arif's Lomisa Trust.</p><p>Shah writes to Rupert Worsdale, a tax expert with Luxemburg advisory and investment firm, Maitland Group, who assisted Doyen and GGK during the original purchase of Kamelot.</p><p>&ldquo;Whilst [the move to Eristavi] may seem straight forward at first,&rdquo; writes Shah, &ldquo;there is a possibility that this debt may not be repaid for a long time, and maybe never. The debt would sit in Eristavi interest free, and would be brought in as another gift either directly into Eristavi, or through the trust. Your thoughts would be appreciated.&rdquo;</p><p>Worsdale agrees to help. According to emails between Amro and Shah the tax lawyer advised that &ldquo;the best option would be to shift it to Eristavi as a Contribution to Capital.&nbsp;There would be no need for&nbsp;interest to be chargeable on this and the &lsquo;debt&rsquo; can sit in Eristavi's books until Kamelot pays it back.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Lomisa%20gift.PNG\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; width: 600px; height: 461px;\\\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In September 2014, DNR begins gifting money to Lomisa &ndash; which disappears into the Doyen black hole of cash. Kamelot continued to trade with a new Panama company, Prime Natural Resources.</p><p>But it was not the only cash to make its way from DNR to Lomisa. A letter dated month earlier shows DNR &ldquo;gifted an additional amount of USD $41,100,000.00 (forty one million one hundred thousand US dollars) to Lomisa Trust.&nbsp; This brings \\\"the total amount gifted to the Trust to $46.1m&rdquo;.</p><p>Like DNR's coal revenues, these millions went to increasing Eristavi's share capital in low-tax Guernsey.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Doyen is dead. Long live Doyen</div><p>Another reason to flee from the Doyan name&nbsp;might have had something to do with a troublesome Bloomberg article published a year earlier. On 2 July, 2013, Bloomberg reporter, Alex Duff, published a piece about the &ldquo;Kazakh Family&rdquo; backers of Doyen Sport's questionable football operation.</p><p>Although the substance of the story was relatively innocuous, it seems that mention of the Arif family, the Savarona yacht and Kazakh connections, was enough to force the family into a frenzy.</p><p>The story was&nbsp;apparently enough to persuade the Arifs to close the UK business and recolate to a tax-friendlier Dubai under the name Doyen Meten. At least on paper. Journalists recently visiting Doyen&rsquo;s London office witnessed a fully staffed operation, with the company plaque still on the door.&nbsp;</p><p>The day after the story was published, Arif Arif complained to Rod Christie-Miller, Chief Executive &amp; Partner at&nbsp;Schillings, a London law firm specialising in defamation and privacy. In the months and years after the Savarona affair, the Arifs employed the servcies of the British privacy law firm, Schillings, and Bell Pottinger, the London PR company famous for scrubbling online criticism of despotic regimes, to remove news stories linking the family to the yacht scandal.</p><p>&ldquo;We don't like fame Rod, and [the journalist] does mention the yacht incident&hellip;&rdquo; Arif Arif wrote.</p><p>&ldquo;I don't know what could be done. In my eyes this isn't a positive article nor does it want to promote us in any way. I view it as attack on our business through using past incidents to add spice to the whole picture. Third-party ownership is looked down upon by animals like [Alex] Duff, because they simply don't understand the business and no one gives them the time of day to explain it. For this reason he slams it.&rdquo;</p><p>Internal communications give a glimpse into why the Arifs&rsquo; are so publicity averse:&nbsp;their relationship with Mashkevich and his &ldquo;friends&rdquo;.</p><p>Following the Savarona affair, relations between Tevfik and the Kazakhs became strained. &ldquo;Mashkevich didn't want nothing to do with us,&rdquo; Arif Arif explained to his sister, Ayla. &ldquo;He blamed dad for everything to cover his own ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;BUT, &ldquo;Ayla responded. &ldquo;On the otherhand, he also is helping dad keep hold of his primary business&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;And he's a great friend for that,&rdquo; Arif said. &ldquo;But he wants to see dad doing good but not better than him.&rdquo;</p><p>When the Bloomberg piece was then picked up by Tukish media, Arif complained again, this time to Nelio Lucas.</p><p>&ldquo;They are bringing up the yacht, the relationship to the PM [Erdo&#287;an], everything,&rdquo; Arif wrote.</p><p>&ldquo;Doyen brand is dead bro. I have to distance myself and the trading from it&hellip;&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Lawyers told [me] &lsquo;now that your father has been identified as a key backer, the [Doyen] name is infected'&rdquo; he added.</p><p>When Nelio reassured Arif that the Bloomberg piece was &ldquo;not that bad&rdquo;, the heir-apparent scolded his friend, reminding him that he had always lived in the civilised world, and could not understand the power of the Kazakhs to interfere with the family&rsquo;s money machine.</p><p>&ldquo;The most important is the kazakhstan issue. [We] Cant let word get out there otherwise we face very big problems.&rdquo; [sic]</p><p>&ldquo;[You] must explain to me,&rdquo; Nelio answers.</p><p>&ldquo;Get it through your head it's not funny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;[The Kazakh&rsquo;s] will ruin us. They will expose us, our businesses and our high level relationships then it's all over.&rdquo;</p><p>The &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; Turkish relationships the Arifs were desperate to protect include several businessmen close to the President.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\"><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&gt; NEXT&nbsp; <a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1281&amp;recType=story\\\">Part Four: Meet the President</a></div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div>&lt; PREVIOUS <a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1279&amp;recType=story\\\">Part Two: Hidden partnerships, the Russian mafia and a future president</a></div></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"d2e335da-1d52-4be6-919f-529c1a0ff60e\"}]"}, "pk": 1280, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Demirhan is a Turkish lawyer and chairman of his own construction and tourism company, Mirhan Holdings.</p><p>He is described inside Doyen as a &ldquo;close friend and partner&rdquo; of the Arifs. According to his own bio, Demirhan &ldquo;was born in 1976 in Istanbul; he is married and has 3 children. He has a BA in Law from Istanbul University.&rdquo;</p><p>He is also reputedly a good friend and supporter of Erdogan: &ldquo;For the past 30 years Mr Demirhan&rsquo;s family has been supporting the political career of Prime Minister Erdo&#287;an,&rdquo; the biography stated.&nbsp;A few years ago he unsuccessfully ran as an MP&nbsp;for the AKP.</p><p>Demirhan became useful almost immediately, during a&nbsp;scandal <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF9mxlp-OH8\\\">involving Sarah Ferguson</a>, Britain's&nbsp;Duchess of York and former wife of Prince Andrew, brother of&nbsp;the heir to the British throne.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"An arrest warrant for Fergie\\\"</div><p>In 2008, the Duchess took part in an undercover documentary on the shabby state of Turkey&rsquo;s orphanages. In the film,&nbsp;disabled chidren were left in their own excrement and one, who was never let outside, had to lay in a corridor close to a&nbsp;window to feel the sunlight on his face.</p><p>The film prompted Turkey's&nbsp;Social Security and Child Services Authority and the Ministry of Family Affairs to lodge a criminal complaint against Ferguson&nbsp;for entering the country under false pretences, and claimed&nbsp;she was part of a &ldquo;smearing campaign against Turkey by [those] opposing Turkey&rsquo;s EU membership.&rdquo;</p><p>The Ministry of Justice even issued an international arrest warrant.</p><p>The Duchess turned to her friend in London, Arif Arif, and Demirhan, to defuse the crisis. Doyen drafted an apology letter for Ferguson addressed to Prime Minister Erdo&#287;an explaining the misunderstanding. It is not clear if the letter was ever delivered, but the charges against Ferguson were eventually dropped.</p><p>Aside from a little PR for former royals, Demirhan assisted Doyen in exploring education and gold deals in Turkey. But he also opened doors for Doyen.</p><p>On a chilly Istanbul evening in the beginning of March 2012, Demirhan introduced Doyen Capital's vice president, Tevfik Eren to Turkey&rsquo;s answer to Donald Trump: Ali Agaoglu &ndash; a real estate magnate close to Erdo&#287;an. Agaoglu has in the past been accused of donating millions to Turgev, the education&nbsp;foundation of Bilal Erdo&#287;an, the president&rsquo;s son, in return for public contracts.</p><p>After a dinner at the up-market Maisa restaurant in Istanbul's bankside neighbourhood &#304;stinye, the trio travelled to Fiyapi Inonu stadium, home of Be&#351;ikta&#351; football club, to watch the team play local side Trabzon. Here, Eren made some important contacts.</p><p>&ldquo;In the half time,&rdquo; Eren writes, &ldquo;Ali [Demirhan] introduced me to Mr Sadik Albayrak and Mr Murat Ulgen, CEO of [Be&#351;ikta&#351;]. Mr Sadik Albayrak is the father of Mr Berat Albayrak, CEO of &Ccedil;al&#305;k Holding, who is also the son-in-law of Mr Recep Tayyip Erdo&#287;an.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Both conversations were short and welcoming,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Ali mentioned briefly about our presence in UK and told that he&rsquo;d introduce me to Mr Berat Albayrak, in order to pursue potential synergies that we might achieve together.&rdquo;</p><p>A&#287;ao&#287;lu arranged meetings for the following day with several other prominent figures, including AKP MP&nbsp;Mikail Arslan, Guney Ikiz, who became head of TGG Construction a year later,&nbsp;Hakan Ferhato&#287;lu, chairman of Ata Invest &amp; board member of construction company, and Yuksel Insaat, involved in the 6.3 billion USD&nbsp;Istanbul-Izmir Highway project.</p><p>It appears that the introductions bore fruit for the ambitious Arif enterprise. Doyen would soon be involved in Turkmenistan energy deals with &Ccedil;al&#305;k Holding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"President Erdogan pictured with Arif 'Arif' Efendi, son of Tevfik Arif (Yalta, Ukraine)\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Arif%20Efendi%2C%20President%20Erdogan_cropped_BW.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 408px; opacity: 0.9; width: 600px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Enter the king of petrol who calls the President \\\"by his first name\\\"</div><p>The energy deals appear to be facilitated by another prominent business connection: Sitki Ayan, chairman of energy trading firm ASB Group and childhood friend of President Erdo&#287;an. Ayan and Erdogan are close. So close that Ayan calls the president by his first name in public and occasionally joins the him on official trips abroad.</p><p>In July 2010, Ayan and the state-owned Iranian National Gas Company declared that Som Petrol, a subsidiary of ASB Group, Ayan&rsquo;s main enterprise, had been awarded a billion Euro contract to help build the &lsquo;Persian pipeline&rsquo; &ndash; a huge, four-year infrastructure project to transport 35 billion cubic metres of natural gas from Iran to the EU, though Turkey.</p><p>The &lsquo;Persian pipeline&rsquo; - or Iran-Turkey-Europe pipeline (ITE) - deal was forged amid increased international pressure to enforce sanctions against the Iranian government over the West&rsquo;s fears of nuclear proliferation.</p><p>Seemingly, the announcement by Ayan and Iranian officials came as a shock to some. Almost immediately, Turkish energy minister, Taner Yildiz, publicly rejected Ayan&rsquo;s claims, declaring that neither the government nor Turkey&rsquo;s Petroleum Pipeline Corporation, BOTA&#350;, had determined who would receive the contract on the Turkish side.</p><p>But Ayan&rsquo;s confidence was not exactly misplaced. Despite ASB Group and SOM seen largely as trading companies, with no experience in infrastructure projects of this size, Erdo&#287;an&rsquo;s cabinet approved the pipeline deal in August &ndash; as Tevfik and his Kazakh friends were preparing their adventures on Ataturk&rsquo;s yacht &ndash; naming SOM Petrol subsidiary, Turang Transit Tasimacilik, as the licensee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Sitki%2C%20Arif%2C%20Agreement.PNG\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 598px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin-right: 5px; margin-left: 5px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A year later, in the autumn of 2011, months after Tevfik was acquitted of the trafficking charges by a Turkish court, the Arifs and Ayan struck a deal for the Iranian gas.</p><p>The Arifs controlled 50 per cent&nbsp;of the new venture, Somas Enerji, which held the rights to sell the gas in Turkey, through ASTU Do&#287;algaz Enerji Ticaret Ltd.,&nbsp;jointly owned by Refik Arif and Malik Ali.</p><p>The Arifs' role was unsurprising, given their background. According to agreements found in the Football Leaks data, they will &ldquo;exclusively manage and conduct negotiations with gas suppliers from the former Soviet Union countries such as Turkmenistan, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan etc,&rdquo; &ndash; in return for 20 per cent of any profits.</p><p>Ayan and his son Bahaddin Ayan&nbsp;would have been&nbsp;tasked with lobbying the &ldquo;Iran government regarding transportation/transit of the natural gas to be transferred to Turkey and/or UAE&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"Bring Barca or Real to Turkmenistan to impress the President\\\"</div><p>The Arifs were true to their word apparently. In May 2012, Turkmenistan Energy Minister Bairamgeldy Nedirov invited Sitki Ayan to a meeting in the capital Ashgabat to discuss electricity exports. Sitki graciously agrees to attend along with &ldquo;Mr. Tefvik Arif, and Mr. Hamid Farzam, as Advisor to Deputy Energy Minister to Iran. [sic]&rdquo;</p><p>At the time, Arif Arif told Nelio Lucas that Doyen was \\\"on the verge of something big in Turkmenistan. This will be Skips masterpiece.\\\"</p><p>As a greaser, he suggested that they \\\"bring either Real Madrid or Barca there to play an exhibition match to impress the president. There are billions to be made there. I need you to take this very serious and start planning asap please&rdquo; [sic].</p><p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Nelio answered, &ldquo;President of Real [Madrid] is in London today. I fly with him to Madrid. A few days later, Nelio updates Arif. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple. 3m &euro; Minimum, and they need to have a date.&rdquo;</p><p>Ultimately, the money never showed up. But the willingness of the family to exploit its football connections was hampered only by a reluctance to part with three million Euro. So&nbsp;Real Madrid escaped having to grandstand for Turkmenistan&rsquo;s autocratic leader, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, in the service of the Arifs&rsquo; business interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Application%2C%20Sitki%2C%20Refik.PNG\\\" style=\\\"width: 600px; height: 439px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But whatever else happened behind the scenes appears to have worked. The following year, the Turkmenenergo State Power Corporation of the Ministry of Energy in Turkmenistan awarded Ayan&rsquo;s company, Gent, the rights to sell electricity to Turkey through Iran.</p><p>The Arifs were placed firmly in the centre of deal.</p><p>Through its holding in ASTU Dogalgaz Enerji, the family owned 50 per cent&nbsp;of ASKA Energy, the company set to sell the electricity on the Turkish market.

On 16 December 2013, the government announced 3.3bn Euro in &ldquo;incentives&rdquo; - customs tax exemptions, tax discounts and social security support &ndash; to Turang Transit for transporting &ldquo;natural gas through pipeline&rdquo;. It was at the time the second highest &ldquo;incentive&rdquo; package ever awarded in Turkey - the highest being awarded to &Ccedil;al&#305;k Holdings &ndash; whose CEO was Berat Albayrak &ndash; for the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline project.</p><p>The following day, Erdo&#287;an&rsquo;s government was hit by a massive corruption scandal, as police arrested over 50 people with links to the AKP - including MPs and members of their families, and businessmen, like Ali A&#287;ao&#287;lu - implicated in a catalogue of financial misdeeds.</p><p>In the end 14 were officially charged with a range of crimes, including bribery, fraud, money laundering and smuggling gold.</p><p>The accusations related to the Turkey&rsquo;s gas deal with Iran. The Iran government was at the time still under international sanctions over its alleged nuclear programme. But Turkey had found a loophole: gold.&nbsp;Sanctions permitted the exporting of gold out of Turkey.</p><p>A scheme was engineered to pay for the gas and oil in Turkish Lira using an account at the county's Halkbank. With over ten billion dollars in revenue, the Iranians purchase gold bullion, which was shipped to Iran though the UAE.</p><p>A week later, the crisis intensified as tapes emerged of conversations between Erdo&#287;an and his son, Bilal, appearing to discuss bribes from Ayan.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. S&#305;tk&#305; came yesterday saying he couldn&rsquo;t do the transfer properly,&rdquo; Bilal says.

Standing proudly in the Seljuk Khan Hall, named after the 11th century Turkic ruler who founded the Seljuk Empire in Central Asia and Anatolia, at the Oguzkhan Presidential Palace, the presidents announced the signing of a &ldquo;Framework Agreement on Cooperation in the field of purchase and sale of the natural gas&rdquo; between Turkmengaz and Atagas Dogalgaz Ticaret A.&#350;, through Iran.</p><p>It was quite a gift. The people now set to get rich from the world&rsquo;s desire to reduce its dependency on controversial Russian energy are none other than Sitki Ayan, the Arifs, and Ahmet &Ccedil;al&#305;k, owner of &Ccedil;al&#305;k Holdings, of which Berat Albayrak&nbsp;used to be CEO.</p><p>Albayrak resigned from &Ccedil;al&#305;k in late 2013 and was appointed Minister for Energy and Natural Resources for the AKP government in 2015.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" height=\\\"233\\\" src=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/FLeaks/Elchin%20message%20to%20Arif(1).PNG\\\" style=\\\"border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\\\" width=\\\"723\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Documents from April 2015 reveal that Sitki transferred half of his shares in Atagas to AST&Uuml; Do&#287;algaz Enerji, the company opened by the Arifs back in 2011 when it engaged in the original Iran pipeline contract.

Are you concerned about the role that agents play in the football market?</strong></p><p>Concerned is not the right expression. But I think we need to restart the whole reflection around transfers. We see how many players are transferred, nationally and internationally. Only in international transfers, two to three&nbsp;billion Euro get moved around every year. These are significant amounts, and a big chunk of that is paid to intermediaries. I think it&rsquo;s really time to analyze what&rsquo;s happening and to look at all these figures that are increasing year by year.</p><p><strong>Do you think too much of that goes to the agents?</strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s too much. The problem is that there&rsquo;s no full transparency. The English association is a role model with publishing the figures of the agents&rsquo; fees. This already helps a little bit. If we can, we need to find a way to bring more transparency in the system.</p><p><strong>We have come across a lot of cases where a club takes the players&rsquo; agent under contract. The agent then may advise his player to join that club, as it is willing to pay the most to the agent. Isn&rsquo;t that the textbook definition for a conflict of interest?</strong></p><p>Yes, it is, of course. The issue is how to regulate conflicts of interests. Before the new Intermediaries Regulations in 2015, this kind of thing wasn&rsquo;t regulated at all. Now agents have to announce if there is a potential conflict of interest before the negotiation starts. And if they do so and everyone involved agrees, that&rsquo;s fine.</p><p><strong>But how realistic is it that the agent equally works for both parties at the same time?</strong></p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s a reality. If things are transparent, if things are open, that&rsquo;s a first step. The question is: Is that enough? All this perceived or real opacity, and with your investigation the perceived becomes real to some extent, shows that we need to look into that. Therefore, I think we really need an in-depth reflection with all the parties: the players, the clubs and the intermediaries, as well as the authorities like the European Commission. We have set up a new stakeholder committee in FIFA for that. It will meet at the beginning of next year for the first time.</p><p><strong>Why did you, with the Intermediaries Regulations from 2015, slack off from the control over players&rsquo; agents and delegated it to the football associations?</strong></p><p>Well, it was FIFA, I was not at FIFA that time.</p><p><strong>So you would like to revise it?</strong></p><p>No, but we need to examine it. In principle, I believe in subsidiarity. It is naive to believe that FIFA from Z&uuml;rich can know exactly what&rsquo;s going on in all transfers around the world. Therefore we hand the responsibility over to the associations and the confederations, in order to check the transfers that happen in their own countries.</p><p><strong>But how could that practically work? The Dutch federation, for example, told us that \\\"because of the many contracts and document complexity, it is impossible for us to control everything\\\". Do you think they have adequate resources?</strong></p><p>Imagine, when even the Dutch federation tells you this, one of the best organized associations in the world! We reach some limits here. FIFA has 211 associations, many of them not as organized as the Dutch. We would need a whole police force to control everyone. Before my time at FIFA, the Transfer Matching System (TMS) was put in place, where each party has to publish the details of a transfer.</p><p>If it turns out that the information that was put in is wrong, we can take disciplinary actions. And maybe we need stronger sanctions for those who repeatedly break the rules. The TMS already has a deterrent effect for these people, so it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction. Is it enough? Well, probably not.</p><p><strong>The TMS statistics show that, for example in August 2016, the payments to agents have gone up and the salaries for players have gone down. Is that a troubling development?</strong></p><p>As long as the agents don&rsquo;t earn more than the players do, I think it&rsquo;s okay. Now, jokes aside, that might be a one-off statistic. It might also be an indicator for the rising power of agents. But let&rsquo;s see if this trend will be confirmed. Then we will look at that as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='\\\"As long as the agents don&rsquo;t earn more than the players do, I think it&rsquo;s okay\\\" (photo copyright; Dominique Duchesnes, Le Soir)' src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Cre%CC%81dit%20Dominique%20Duchesnes%20(11).jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 900px; height: 599px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Although everyone is obliged to disclose the activity of the agent, according to our research it seems very widespread that the agents&rsquo; participation is not always disclosed. Why would that be?</strong></p><p>That&rsquo;s a good question. Obviously, if somebody doesn&rsquo;t disclose something, it&rsquo;s because he might have something to hide.</p><p><strong>It seems like there are a lot of people who have something to hide in the transfer business.</strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a lot of people or not. I tend to believe that the majority of the people, and therefore also the transfer system, are honest. I hope so. Having said that, that&rsquo;s not a reason for not always trying to increase and improve the control mechanisms that we have put in place. But we are no law enforcement agency. When you have to put your data in the TMS, it is already a threshold against abuse. But we need to do more.</p><p><strong>Tax authorities in several countries have said that it is a problem when the players&rsquo; agent is paid by the club because the parties can save income tax and VAT. </strong></p><p><strong>Jos&eacute; Mourinho for example was fined by Spanish tax authorities. Why do FIFA regulations allow something that is considered a scheme of tax evasion in multiple countries?</strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t think that this is a question of FIFA regulations. Everyone has to pay taxes and follow the law and everyone is responsible in front of the law enforcement agencies and the tax authorities. If anything happens in contravention of some national tax rule or law, they have to look at it. The complex situation for FIFA is to have regulation that sets the frame for the whole world.</p><p><strong>So you don&rsquo;t plan on changing anything despite legal problems in some countries?</strong></p><p>We will discuss the whole situation and tax issues are maybe one part. But FIFA cannot be responsible for somebody paying or not paying taxes.</p><p><strong>But you must be concerned about the integrity of the game, right?</strong></p><p>Definitely.</p><p><strong>You just said everyone needs to pay taxes, obviously. Of the biggest stars in football, Lionel Messi got convicted for tax fraud, Cristiano Ronaldo has at least a tax evasion scheme. Do you think that&rsquo;s problematic for the integrity of the game?</strong></p><p>If somebody doesn&rsquo;t pay taxes or drives too fast in his car or causes an accident while being drunk or whatever, this is not FIFA&rsquo;s responsibility. But if we can help to bring transparency in the financial transactions around football and in the respect of the laws generally, then we have to do it. The integrity of the game is crucial for us. That&rsquo;s why, for example, we banned third-party-ownership (TPO) of players.</p><p><strong>TPO is considered problematic because it could lead to external parties meddling with the clubs&rsquo; transfer policies. Do you think you have successfully curtailed its practice?</strong></p><p>No. Not yet. But we have only started. There were some court challenges in different countries. Until now, we raised awareness for something that was not regarded as an issue before. You can still cheat, yes. But there is a higher threshold than before.</p><p><strong>But you still leave open some possibilities, for example for a third party to invest into a club and participate in the overall transfer income. Why are you not once and for all closing investment opportunities that could leave loopholes for influencing transfers?</strong></p><p>We need investors in football. FIFA, UEFA, the associations, the clubs. We need investors. Obviously it may not be their only purpose to transfer as many players as possible in order to make money. That was a business model of traders who did that through TPO and it was detrimental to both the club as well as the players.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what needs to be regulated. Third-party-investment (TPI) in general is welcome, and with measures like UEFA&rsquo;s Financial Fairplay we try to attract good investors. If somebody invests and works legitimately, it&rsquo;s fair if he has a fair return. But it should be a long-term deal. That&rsquo;s what I mean with good investors.</p><p><strong>Did the TPO-ban financially impact the market so far?</strong></p><p>Well, the figures go up quite steadily. We believe that the TPO-ban has certainly avoided some situations that existed before. Maybe the rising figures are a reflection of the TPO-ban, of amounts that were hidden before and now at least are open.</p><p><strong>Mr. Infantino, many football fans love the sport but hate FIFA&hellip;</strong></p><p>&hellip;yes, sadly&hellip;</p><p><strong>&hellip; Corruption affairs have shattered FIFA&rsquo;s credibility. The next world cups will be in Russia, which is a country with a proven record of institutionalized doping and Qatar, and the circumstances of that nomination process will loom over FIFA for years to come. What needs to happen that the fans can trust your organization better?</strong></p><p>We need to show to the fans, and I hope we are starting to do that, that we&rsquo;re working in a serious and honest way, in the interest of football. Football is a global sport, which brings all countries of the world together, aside of their political situation.</p><p>In this respect, the transparency that we put into place, coupled with a little bit of tolerance and open spirit, should help the fans to realize that the only thing we try to achieve is that we can play football all over the world. You know, there are people living in Russia and Qatar, there are people everywhere in the world who love football. Boycotts and exclusions have never brought any solution. If there are issues, let&rsquo;s face them, let&rsquo;s tackle them, let&rsquo;s discuss them, let&rsquo;s look forward.</p><p><strong>Do you think about taking any consequences from the McLaren-report?</strong></p><p>No. FIFA is not the world police and especially not the world doping police. It&rsquo;s the football governing body. Whatever has to do with football in the McLaren-report will be looked at by our disciplinary bodies. If there are any measures to be taken, they will do that.</p><p><strong>But so far you don&rsquo;t plan to take any specific measures?</strong></p><p>No, our bodies are still waiting to see all the relevant information. FIFA has its own anti-doping-system. Doping tests were not done by Brazil in 2014 or by South Africa in 2010, and they won&rsquo;t be done by Russia in 2018 &ndash; FIFA will manage that. If anything goes wrong, it will be our responsibility, our fault. But we&rsquo;re very confident that our anti-doping procedures will work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"187c50e4-3c9e-4543-8ae8-d467864e6131\"}]"}, "pk": 1282, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Not reflection</div><p>Lenin&rsquo;s party slogan&nbsp;&ldquo;it is necessary to dream&rdquo; runs through the ideological veins of Socialist art. Following the 1917 revolution in Russia, theorists envisaged art as vehicle for realising these dreams. Art was action. Not reflection.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Art as a method of knowing life&hellip;is the highest content of bourgeois aesthetics,&rdquo; wrote Bolshevik journalist Nikolai Chuzhak. &ldquo;A method for building life - this is the slogan behind the proletarian conception of the science of art.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Works were designed to depict this society, even if it didn&rsquo;t yet exist, through the&nbsp;intention that art would enable it to become a reality.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">From the 1930s, under Stalin&rsquo;s doctrine of Socialist Realism, characterized by the depiction of communist values, such as the emancipation of the proletariat, large public murals, mostly mosaics, were commissioned across the Soviet Union. Artworks promoted principles that were seen as intrinsic to the sustenance of a harmonious communist society, and tactically installed in places of influence.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In Kyiv, such pieces still exist, but mostly on the outskirts of the city. Venturing to the left bank of the river Dnipro, several are&nbsp;intact.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Guarding run-down housing estates in some of the city&rsquo;s poorer districts such as Dniprovskiy and Desnianskyi, they are well preserved, proud monuments to the Communist state, a stark contrast to the crumbling tower blocks that surround them.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">On the fa&ccedil;ade of a school buried between run-down Breznevka flats in the commuter neighbourhood of Troieschyna, is a piece by Ukrainian-born artist Volodymyr Pryadka. It still maintains its vibrant Soviet-red hues and promotes education, strength and unity (see above, first image on page).</p><p>Another, positioned on the edge of a busy ring-road nearby, depicts scientists, farmers and factory workers (below).

Failure to do so was interpreted as an indication of political disagreement with the party, which even if carried out subconsciously, would land artists in prison.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Soviet Union provided the perfect environment for the experiment of shaping a new reality through art, as the effects of a revolution were more radical in the east than they were ever going to be in the west.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This is because the west was confined by its debt to tradition and previous intellectual, political and cultural achievements. The political shapers of the post-revolution east thrived off this advantage, associating tradition with inferiority, and thus Russia and the Soviet Union were more receptive to some new forms of art.</p><div>&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Celebrating Ukraine&rsquo;s self-definition: Mural by Seth Globepainter (France), Olhynska Str\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/5(1).jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 568px; width: 850px;\\\"></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Walls of Freedom</div><p>Kyiv&rsquo;s current political climate similarly provides an environment that allows ideologically-fuelled street art to thrive.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Works champion strength and&nbsp;freedom, and are mostly patriotic. Walking through downtown Kiev, there are an abundance of murals featuring national figures such as poet Lesia Ukrainka, dressed in traditional folk costumes and doused in the blue and yellow of the national flag.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">While Soviet art was funded by the party, these pieces are funded in a similar manner, filtered through charities, NGOs and organisations affiliated with the Ukrainian government and the governments of countries aligned with Ukraine&rsquo;s aspirations to be part of the EU.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">One organisation that has curated many murals throughout Kyiv is &lsquo;Art United Us&rsquo;, which works in collaboration with city mayor Vitali Klitschko. Unlike Soviet artists, the creators of the organisation began their venture independently, but had to seek legal permission to create the murals in public spaces.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">One of the group&rsquo;s founders, Geo Leros, tried to bluff his way into the Kyiv city council to present his ideas - only to be detained by the security guards.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">It wasn&rsquo;t until a member of Klitschko&rsquo;s team stepped in, that the organisation was granted a meeting with the mayor and&nbsp;received permission to decorate the empty spaces of the city. However there is little doubt that this would have happened if the organisation didn&rsquo;t advocate the Government&rsquo;s aspirations to be closer to the EU.</p><p>Like in Soviet times, the creators of this street art are embedded in the government, and Leros was&nbsp;awarded a role in Ukraine&rsquo;s Ministry of Information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Nationalistic upsurge: 'Renaissance' by Seth Globepainter (France), Borychiv Tik Str. 33\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/face.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 566px; width: 850px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Following the success of the project in Kyiv, Art United Us went on to continue working in collaboration with the Poroshenko-backed Government, curating patriotic art in Ukraine&rsquo;s 'Anti-terrorist Operation&rsquo; zones in the country&rsquo;s war-torn region of Donbass.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">While post-revolution Russia provided a timely environment for the introduction of Socialist art, post-Maidan Ukraine provides an opportune landscape for Eurocentric tropes.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In cities across the Western world from Berlin to New York, street art has developed beyond the amateur, with its stencilists and muralists now deemed professional artists in their own right.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In a public space, the works are still associated with the rebellious roots and illegal tags from which they stemmed from and thus resemble a symbol of creative freedom.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Free from the confines of the gallery walls, graffiti works are often viewed as edgy tourist attractions.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Many artists commissioned to create murals around Kyiv are not from Ukraine.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Around the corner from the menacing Stalinist pillars of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stands a mural by Portuguese Alexandre Farto that pays tribute to Serhiy Nigoyan, the first person to be shot dead during the Euromaidan protests.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A piece by French artist Seth Globepainter has a prominent place in Kyiv&rsquo;s old town, perched on a cobbled hill surrounded by touristic cafes and make-shift stalls selling trinkets and souvenirs, including toilet paper printed with the face of disgraced ex-President Yanukovich. Titled &lsquo;Renaissance&rsquo;, the work depicts a young Maidan protester wearing a military jacket and a traditional Vinok flower crown (above).</p><p>Another by Globepainter, tucked in a side street next to the &lsquo;Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred&rsquo; boulevard, named as a tribute to the protesters who died under sniper-fire in February 2014, depicts two figures wearing colours of the Ukrainian flag breaking free from chains (two images above).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Personal revolution: &lsquo;The Dreamer&rsquo; by Fintan Magee (Australia), Stritenska Str.\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/3(1).jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 569px; width: 850px;\\\"></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Artists from Brazil to Australia contribute work that is patriotic in its nature. According to Leros, who often curates the pieces, &ldquo;artists from around the world are more interested in Ukrainian traditions and identity than local artists [because]&nbsp;local artists grew up with it.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Through Ukraine&rsquo;s desire to Westernise itself and to be&nbsp;viewed as a place that is free and able to adapt aesthetically to Europe, street murals can&nbsp;thrive and follow the same utopian&nbsp;function as&nbsp;Soviet art - through the hope that the depiction of this would enable it to turn into a reality. &nbsp;</p><div>&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Decommunisation Whitewash</div><p>Part of this Westernisation is the act of &lsquo;decommunisation&rsquo;, which culminates in the removal or adaption of anything associated with the county&rsquo;s Soviet past.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Last May, the Government changed the industrial central city Dnipropetrovsk, named after a Russified moniker in 1926, to the shorter &lsquo;Dnipro&rsquo;. This also means a &lsquo;lustration&rsquo; move, common in other east European countries, which is the act of purging officials with communist ties from parliament. But decommunisation extends beyond these to works of art.</p><p>Like in Moscow, many of Kyiv&rsquo;s most impressive Soviet art works were not above ground - but&nbsp;in the underbelly of the city&rsquo;s underground metro. However many of these works have now been stripped bare. While Soviet-era trains, rickety escalators and dim antique lighting remain, symbolic mosaics have been plied out and removed.&nbsp;</p><p>A sculpture of a woman inside a hammer and sickle that stood on the platform of the Polytechnic Institute station was&nbsp;targeted during the removals, and has now had her hammer removed (below)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"In the cosmos: Politekhnichnyi Instytut (USSR) (credit: Wikimedia Commons)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Politekhnichnyi_instytut_metro_station_Kiev_07.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 437px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Following the 2015 decommunisation laws, hammer extracted, sickle remains\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Hammered.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 402px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Palats Ukrayina, which was originally named after the Red Army, is another&nbsp;station&nbsp;that underwent a significant make-under.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Once lined with crimson mosaics that paid tribute to the October revolution, the station had its Red Army soldiers removed and hammer and sickles torn out and covered with stark metal sheets (below).</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Former Red Army station, now Palats Ukrayina Metro Station, Kyiv (credit: http://dreamkyiv.com)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Hammer%20Sickle%201.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 383px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Steel-clad censorship: following Decommunisation, all symbols from patterns across platform removed\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Hammer%20sickle%202.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 388px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The only artworks that are &lsquo;safe&rsquo; are normally ones that are related to sport, such as Olympic-themed murals, or those that focus on nature.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Decommunisation is not only a symbolic dissociation from the country&rsquo;s Soviet past, but the removal or adaption of pieces suggests that they are considered offensive, and damaging to current ideologies.

Some are mini-breakers, others pilgrims, some catch a bus to the cruise ships on the Med, or race for a coach to Fiumicino airport. They are in a hurry. Nervous.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They don&rsquo;t speak Italian. Don&rsquo;t know where to go. How to get there. Who to ask.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">These are targets.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The station has its own police force. To meet with their boss, one has to walk nearly a kilometre down the eastern platform to a large room with cordoned offices. The station is packed with shelves of files that litter the tight corridors.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The slim, forty-something head of the police, Emanuele Fattori, calls Termini &ldquo;the central point of Italy&rdquo; and refuses to say how many officers work at the station (it is classified).</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Although terrorist attacks are the major&nbsp;threat to this transport hub, the station experiences a common nuisance of gangs looking to squeeze cash out of the masses teaming through the arcades and ticket barriers.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">And for two years until 2014, the station was tormented by 20&nbsp;Romanian beggars, aged between 12 and 17.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Japanese: &ldquo;top target&rdquo;</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">At first, the kids were helping passengers with their luggage. Always the Asians, and especially the Japanese. This was not out of charity. After they hauled a suitcase 100 metres across a concourse, or down a flight of stairs, the kids expected a tip of between 20 and 50 Euro.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;If they weren&rsquo;t paid, around three or four of them would crowd around the tourists and refuse to return the baggage until they were given money,&rdquo; says Fattori.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">While transporting the luggage, they were stealing phones or wallets from the passenger&rsquo;s handbag. The police caught on, picked up the kids and questioned them.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The gang lived with 300 other Romanians in a squat inside abandoned buildings in the town of Aprilia, 50 km from Rome. The residents were mostly from the Danube town of Calafat, where they had traditionally been wood-carvers.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;There is a very big problem in Italy of children who come from Roma families used for begging,&rdquo; says Vincenzo Nicoli, Second Department of the Central Operative Service in the Italian Police.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;In the north of Italy initiatives were made against this. The problem it is that as soon as you start a police initiative, they change their behavior. For example if I [as a criminal] am out with a child during school hours and the child is eight years old, I risk criminal arrest. But if I beg with a four-year old child [which is not the compulsory school age], I don't run any risk.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">\\\"There needs to be a combined social, cultural and police activity [to remedy this] - if it is only with the police, this will have a limited effect.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In the Termini station, the kids were on their own. They had no adult overseers. Most were under 14, some as young as ten. Until the age of 14, a child cannot be kept in juvenile detention in Italy. They are the responsibility of their parents. The state can also put them in a children&rsquo;s home. But if a kid wants to leave a children&rsquo;s home - all he or she has to do is open the door of the building and walk out.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Although they were picked up, they could not be detained.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">So they came back to Termini.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But they wised up.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">This time, they stopped helping Japanese people with their baggage while stealing their iPhones.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They shifted to a new activity.</p><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/termini2.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 900px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Toilet sex with pensioners&rdquo;</div><p>The police noticed how the children were walking up to men, asking for their telephone numbers and pressing these into their own cellphones. These were older men - in their 50s and 60s, even 70s or more.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;That was quite weird,&rdquo; says Fattori.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The police intercepted the telephones and found that around 14 boys and six girls were arranging to meet old Italian men for sex.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The kids, some as young as 14, gathered opposite McDonald&rsquo;s at the west entrance to the main station and near the stairs to the Metro. Here they would stand, scan the passengers as they walked past, try to catch the eye of a man, then fold their tongue, and stick it out of a closed mouth. This was the sign for offering gay sex.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Where regional trains stopped in the station for over an hour, the boys would meet the clients in the carriage toilets.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">They would also have assignations in the lavatory of McDonald&rsquo;s. If the client was carrying a bit more cash, they went to a nearby hotel, where the owners would not record the names of the guests.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Because some of these&nbsp;kids were under&nbsp;16, this was child abuse. The price the clients paid to abuse these kids was between 10 and 50 Euro for boys and 20 and 50 Euro for girls.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">According to the results of the investigation, there was no pimp or an organized trafficking network. The boys would share the phone numbers of clients between themselves. They were not violent - and did not steal from the clients. Even though, in many cases, the clients were rich and important. They included a doctor, a surgeon, a former judge and two priests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Viagra and boys twice a day&rdquo;</div><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">An eighty-year old man used to come to the station in the morning. He lived in a retirement home in the north of Rome. He would eat his breakfast at the home, pop a Viagra and come to the station. As the drug fired blood to the pensioner&rsquo;s libido, he would find a Romanian boy at the west exit and arrange a rendezvous around the corner - at a hotel on Piazza Vittorio Emanuele.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Then he would catch a train back to the retirement home. At the fixed time of 12:00 he had to be there - as this was when the kitchen served up lunch.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">After his meal, he would pop another Viagra, return to the station, arrange another meeting with a boy, and rendezvous with the kid at the same hotel on the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">After the police cracked down on the operation, he died of a heart attack.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The police caught one underage girl in a park near the station with an older Italian man. He was touching her &ldquo;sexually&rdquo;, says Fattori.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">When the police accosted the two, the girl said that nothing illegal was going on. She claimed she had &ldquo;a terrible ache in my stomach and this man was just massaging me&rdquo;.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Of course the kids knew what they were doing,&rdquo; says Fattori.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">So the cops rounded up the kids and seized their phones. Prosecutors used the information to indict 20 men. The judge took the evidence from the children and released them back to their families. The kids were worried they may face threats from the clients. The case is still ongoing. But the kids will not need to testify again.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Afterwards, many moved away from Italy. Some went to England, and others to Spain. The police do not know what happened to them.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;Perhaps they go out of station and meet [clients] in another part of Rome,&rdquo; says Fattori, &ldquo;but they don&rsquo;t have sexual rapports in the station anymore.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Fattori says the families knew their children were in prostitution. Some mothers were even encouraging the children to have sex with older men.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But the kids would not admit to this.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">None of them.</p><p>Fattori says they told him: &ldquo;My Mama did not know.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Cecilia Ferrara works for the<a href=\\\"https://irpi.eu/\\\"> Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPI)</a></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>For more on how Romanians settled in Italy,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1243&amp;recType=multimedia\\\">read our interviews with residents of favelas</a>&nbsp;at the edge of Naples</em></p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p><p>Part of&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/eurocrimes\\\">The Black Sea #Eurocrimes</a>&nbsp;project financed by:</p><p><a href=\\\"http://journalismfund.eu/\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/journalismfundlogo.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 327px;\\\"></a></p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"b2f5dffb-04c6-4a40-9c24-60050e25dc2b\"}]"}, "pk": 1293, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

The trip was to Cambodia to highlight the work done by Unicef with child victims of abuse and the ex-footballer was mixing his charity role with business while out in the Far East.</p><p>It was Unicef&rsquo;s understanding that, as a result, Beckham was being flown to Cambodia on a private plane which was supporting his Far Eastern tour.</p><p>&ldquo;We are understand (sic) DB was on a private jet so the Fund wouldn&rsquo;t need to pay for his travel,&rdquo; Chloe Edwards, Unicef&rsquo;s ambassador relations manager, wrote back.</p><p>But a second director from the Beckham&rsquo;s company, DB Ventures Ltd, was unrelenting. &ldquo;There is an allocation in the agreement for DB travel and that is 1 x business class return for any field trips,&rdquo; the director wrote. &ldquo;We will always do everything we can to allocate costs away from Unicef and minimise any expenditure but I need to be able to bill what&rsquo;s agreed.&rdquo;</p><p>These exchanges are contained in leaked documents seen by media from the network European Investigative Collaborations, which raise serious questions about how the charity was being used to maximise the profits of &lsquo;Brand Beckham&rsquo;, the highly successful business which made around &pound;45m in 2015.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Beckham in his playing days for LA Galaxy in 2007 (Wikimedia commons: Calebrw)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/David_Beckham_Nov_11_2007%20Credit-%20Calebrw%20.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 317px; opacity: 0.9; width: 300px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Charity role has \\\"halo effect of the positive PR coverage\\\"</div><p>The leaks from 2015 show clearly that Beckham has a mixed attitude towards the charity. He was prepared to give up his time to be photographed with children in peril around the world - thereby raising his profile and awareness of the charity&rsquo;s work. But at that time, it&nbsp;appears he was not willing to dip into his own personal fortune to give the charity any money.</p><p>However, his chief lieutenants reveal in the leaks how his charity role was vital to the Beckham brand because it creates a &ldquo;halo effect of the positive PR coverage&rdquo;. This, according to a second key member of his staff &ldquo;will generate huge income in a business that already has an unbelievably amount of success and a enormous financial profit&rdquo;.</p><p>The emails have emerged from the Football Leaks database containing 18.6 million documents, which was originally handed to the German magazine Der Spiegel. They passed it on media partners in the European Investigative Collaborations in what has been called the largest leaks in sports history.</p><p>&lsquo;Brand Beckham&rsquo; is a brilliant money-making creation. The leaked emails show how the brand is managed and maintained with great skill by two key people in Beckham&rsquo;s life: Simon Oliveira and David Gardner.</p><p>Oliveira is the managing director of Doyen Global, a sports and entertainment agency, is a clever public relations executive who manages the star&rsquo;s &ldquo;communications, reputational and philanthropic strategy&rdquo;.</p><p>David Gardner is a friend he has known since his days in the Manchester United youth team. Nicknamed Dava in the emails, he formerly ran a football agency with Sir Alex Ferguson&rsquo;s son Jason and is married to Hollywood actress Liv Tyler.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Man of the people&rdquo;</div><p>The emails suggest that, at times, Beckham is a puppet for the sake of the brand although sometimes he battles to regain control. An example is an email conversation between Beckham and Oliveira in May last year on the seemingly mundane matter of his Instagram account. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to also be able to be in control of pics that go up and also the way some of its written &hellip; I&rsquo;d like to be able to post,&rdquo; Beckham wrote.</p><p>This prompted a tetchy aside from Oliveira to Gardner. &ldquo;This is when things go to pot,&rdquo; snapped Oliveira. &ldquo;Celebs think they know best but because they don&rsquo;t live in the real world like you and I make mistakes.&rdquo;</p><p>It had followed a similar incident the day before when Beckham had been delighted to receive a new Mac lap-top in ostentatious gold. &ldquo;First one in the world&hellip; Great present,&rdquo; Beckham wrote to Oliveira enclosing a photo of himself with the computer. Oliveira was not impressed.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice will keep that one of (sic) social media as then the idiots will they say we&rsquo;re being showy like Lewis Hamilton private planes etc. You and vb [his wife Victoria] need to be careful about that one as you've always handled that well. You&rsquo;re the man of the people,&rdquo; he wrote.</p><p>'Man of the people' is one of the core features of the projected Beckham public persona which Oliveira manages so well. It is an image that has attracted countless millions of pounds in commercial sponsorship deals and given Beckham and his wife Victoria&rsquo;s a personal fortune which almost matches the wealth of the queen, according to The Sunday Times Rich List.</p><p>He is the shy and self-effacing boy-next-door who loves his family and is still in touch with his working class roots - and happens to be the ex-England football captain who still looks hot in his underpants. His advisers have skilfully built on these attributes to turn the formerly floppy-haired footballer into one of the most recognisable people in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"It's not for vanity\\\"</div><p>Beckham earns more in retirement then he did as a player, but he needs continued exposure to keep the brand going. This is perhaps why his advisers saw his role as a Unicef goodwill ambassador as so important.</p><p>Gardner had introduced Beckham to Unicef in 2005 while he was still a player. He quit football in 2013 - and later in 2015 he declared that he was going to make a charity fund for UNICEF his<a href=\\\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/09/football/david-beckham-unicef-seven-fund\\\"> &ldquo;number one priority&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Beckham even stated that his role for charity was not to improve his image - in an&nbsp;interview for <a href=\\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1z8XT9v15wPV17CygBJCY7S/12-things-we-learnt-from-david-beckham-s-desert-island-discs?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_radio_4&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_linkname=radio_and_music\\\">BBC Radio's Desert Island Discs</a>, where celebrities choose the pieces of music that mean most to their lives.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for vanity,&rdquo; he said of his work for Unicef.</p><p>He recalled going to Thailand for the first time with Manchester United, being invited to a women&rsquo;s centre and immediately wanting to learn more.</p><p>He remembered thinking: &ldquo;I want to get involved, it&rsquo;s important that I do this.&rdquo;</p><p>However, the leaked emails show that Beckham did not act like a puppet for his advisers when it came to the charity work. He would often be stubborn about how much time he would devote to Unicef and was determined not to pay his own money to the charity.</p><p>In February 2014, he emailed his right-hand man Gardner to say he&rsquo;d been contacted by one of his directors at DB Ventures who was unhappy that the company was contributing towards his Unicef trip the following week. Beckham was visiting the Philippines to meet children affected by Typhoon Haiyan.</p><p>Beckham wrote:&ldquo;I totally agree to be honest there&rsquo;s no way it should be costing me anything&rdquo;.</p><p>Gardner agreed to let the charity know but he wasn&rsquo;t entirely in line with his friend on the issue, which became clear in a highly revealing email two days later. Gardner was concerned that Beckham&rsquo;s company had not appreciated the wider commercial value of the charity role to the brand.</p><p>&ldquo;UNICEF is crucial to the brand and his life,&rdquo; Gardner wrote to Oliveira. &ldquo;All me and you have tried to do is &hellip; create things that he must do for charity so he looks good and people see the great work instead of people constantly reading how much money he makes or what the brand is worth.</p><p>He added: &ldquo;The charity work is crucial and nobody seems to realise how important this is as a part of the DB Business.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2015, Beckham made a big charity announcement to celebrate ten years as a goodwill ambassador to Unicef. He was creating the 7 Fund in a joint venture with Unicef to raise money in seven regions across the world to help children in danger from violence abuse or disease.</p><p>In a video produced for the Fund, Beckham talks movingly about his charity work. &ldquo;We are helping millions of children around the world by stepping up to the plate and putting this fund together,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>The implication was that Beckham was going to personally donate to his new fund, and certainly Unicef and Beckham&rsquo;s own advisers thought so. Among the leak documents is a sheet of answers to possible questions which were prepared in advance for Beckham ahead of the press conference to launch the fund in February 2015. It specifically says he should answer &ldquo;yes I am going to personally contribute to the fund&rdquo; if asked whether he was going to donate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;I won't do it with my own money&rdquo;</div><p>This, however, was to become a running sore through most of 2015. Beckham may have been happy to take the advice of his advisers on most subjects, but during this time, when it came paying out his own money, he put his foot down.</p><p>In May 2015 Oliveira informed Beckham that Unicef were under the impression he would match the highest donation pledge at a Unicef charity event in New York in May 2015: &ldquo;Great thing to do,&rdquo; Oliveira wrote, &ldquo;but as always I wanted to check.&rdquo;</p><p>Beckham didn&rsquo;t agree. He had already had a conversation about the subject with Chloe Edwards, the ambassador relations manager at Unicef. He wrote back: &ldquo;Chloe asked me out right which I was pissed off about &hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to do it and won&rsquo;t do it with my own money.&rdquo;</p><p>The issue was clearly worrying Unicef, and they sought reassurance. In June Edwards emailed Oliveira asking him to send an email by return to &ldquo;allay fears&rdquo; about when the money would arrive so the charity could &ldquo;commit resource and commit funds to literally pack aid boxes&rdquo;. She added &ldquo;we have no extra funds to draw on if they are delayed and the countries are expecting the funds.&rdquo;</p><p>Her suggested text for Oliveira started with &ldquo;I understand there has been considerable anxiety about when David&rsquo;s personal donations will arrive at Unicef UK&rdquo;. Oliveira struck out &ldquo;considerable&rdquo; and replaced it with &ldquo;some&rdquo; then sent back the email copying in Unicef&rsquo;s director of fundraising Catherine Cottrell.</p><p>The PR executive promised the money in the Autumn and wrote that this &ldquo;should be close to $1.5m money he kindly wants to give the proceeds to the Fund.&rdquo;</p><p>The Unicef director wrote back to ask for a firm date &ldquo;as this work with children is so pressing&rdquo;. She added: &ldquo;We need to make sure they can plan accordingly and are ready to receive the funds they so desperately need. This also mitigates the risk of the DB7 Fund being perceived as not delivering the ambitious targets it set out at the launch.&rdquo;</p><p>At the same time, another set of emails were being exchanged between team Beckham and Unicef. Beckham had agreed to visit Cambodia in mid June 2015 on behalf of the 7 Fund to meet children who had suffered physical and mental abuse. But there were problems.</p><p>He was combining the trip to the Far East with work for his sponsors, the Sands Hotel group (where he has been an &lsquo;ambassador&rsquo;) and the Diageo drinks company, and his private air travel had been provided for.</p><p>However, out of the blue, the charity received a message from Helen Wooldridge, a director at DB Ventures. It said: &ldquo;I also understand that you guys pay for a business class fare for DB &ndash; as per the contract,&rdquo; wrote Wooldridge, &ldquo;The cost of this comes in at &pound;6685.00 &ndash; how should we bill this back?&rdquo;</p><p>A colleague at DB Ventures pushed further for the payment they were worried about the expenses of the footballer&rsquo;s entourage for the trip to the Far East which was costing more than they thought, it appears.</p><p>The charity took the issue up with Oliveira: &ldquo;We understood that DB is generously utilising the private jet that is supporting his Asian tour to drop him off and pick him up in Cambodia and that we wouldn&rsquo;t be paying for flights,&rdquo; wrote Edwards. &ldquo;We are obliged to share the Fund&rsquo;s income and costs and I was concerned that we were being asked to pay for the cost of his business class flight when he&rsquo;s not taking one.&rdquo;</p><p>The email chain peters out at that point and the matter was clearly discussed further over the phone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Unicef: the 7 Fund has \\\"raised millions\\\"</div><p>Last week Unicef, in a written statetment, informed us that the 7 Fund has raised &ldquo;millions of pounds and reached millions of people around the world with crucial messages about UNICEF&rsquo;s work for very vulnerable children.&rdquo;</p><p>It states&nbsp;that, as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, &ldquo;David has also helped shine a light on urgent and often hidden issues affecting children including malnutrition, emergencies, violence against children and AIDS.&rdquo;</p><p>But there were other issues with this&nbsp;trip. Unicef had booked Beckham into a five-star Sofitel Hotel in Cambodia, but the football icon wanted to stay in the even more luxurious Amansara resort. One of the directors of his company wrote to the charity asking whether it was okay to switch hotels.</p><p>But the multi-millionaire&rsquo;s staff still wanted the charity to pay its portion of the bill. &ldquo;Would UNICEF contribute the same amount that was being paid for the Sofitel and he&rsquo;ll make up the difference in price for the place he wants to stay,&rdquo; asked the director.</p><p>Beckham&rsquo;s staff had also been worried that he would only want to stay one night. At the time this was an issue as Beckham was refusing to sign a new contract which would tie him down to a certain number of Unicef days a year.</p><p>The simmering tensions about Beckham&rsquo;s commitment to his charity were beginning to boil over back in London. &ldquo;He has just signed to arguably the most biggest charitable partnership any celebrity has ever done,&rdquo; Oliveira wrote to a director of Beckham&rsquo;s company. &ldquo;He had visited none of his projects yet and we are not placing the most challenging demands on his schedule.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to ensure he shows dedication and concern. If he's scooting off after one day in the field on his private jet to his six star hotel curtailing his time on the ground then it doesn't look great.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Six months after fund launch&nbsp;Beckham had \\\"not paid\\\" into own charity</div><p>But by August 2015 - six months after the launch of the 7 Fund - Beckham still had not paid any of his own money to the charity. Oliveira emailed Beckham to say: &ldquo;As you know we are under enormous pressure to deliver income into your Fund. As is understandable you don&rsquo;t want to put your own money but then it places a greater emphasis on delivering some money before the end of this year.&rdquo;</p><p>Later that month he emailed again to suggest ways of raising the cash. He wrote: &ldquo;As you know we need to address urgently the need to bring income into the 7 Fund &hellip; Many of the projects are desperate for the first round of money and to be honest UNICEF are being patient in not pushing too much.&rdquo;</p><p>He urged Beckham to consider two fee-paying appearances to cover the shortfall. The first was a personal appearance at the African Games the following month, in which he would be paid one million dollars to open a stadium and attend a dinner. The second was an awards evening in Shanghai which was also offering a million for a few hours work. Beckham&rsquo;s rejection of the two offers was brief. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s think about this as neither sound great.&rdquo;</p><p>Clearly frustrated, Oliveira pointed out that it was expected that ambassadors to Unicef &ldquo;would put in a kick start amount of money from their own earnings&rdquo;. He continued: &ldquo;It just wouldn&rsquo;t reflect well on you that you have kicked off this incredible fund that is unique and original and that nothing has come from you personally in the first year. We are your mates and will always be honest with you..&rdquo;</p><p>But Beckham stood his ground. His argument was that his role was &ldquo;about me using my power&rdquo; to raise money. He added &ldquo;This needs to be about &hellip; not me travelling and adding to my travel which I'm doing enough of already, it all has to fit into what we are already doing&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The leaked email trail stops at the beginning of the year the latest records filed with the Charity Commission show that the 7 Fund has so far raised a total of two million pounds.</p><p>But there was one last long email in November 2015 which showed how Gardner - the man who had set up Beckham&rsquo;s link to Unicef - saw the charity role. Beckham was central to a project which would be shown that Christmas in which he played seven football games in seven continents to raise money for his fund.</p><p>Gardner had been queried from the accountants over a dinner bill. He wrote: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s madness how we receive these mails when we are absolutely working ourselves for the benefit of the brand.</p><p>&ldquo;This whole trip will not change my life or anyone else involved except the brands and DB which is a huge part of the business and will generate more and more commercial partners, income and commercial deals. It is crazy how we have these mails and it&rsquo;s really upsetting when the only people who benefit are the brand and BVL.</p><p>&ldquo;I really don't understand after flying to 6 countries in 5 days for a BBC documentary that will go on air on Boxing day at 8:30pm and will be seen by millions and millions of people which will benefit DB and the DVBL brand business which will generate huge income in a business that already has a unbelievably amount of success and a enormous financial profit.&rdquo;</p><p>In reply to this information, lawyers have told us that Beckham has to date donated over one million pounds to Unicef, and paid all the costs incurred related to the flights and hotel accommodation mentioned.</p><p>The donations happened many months&nbsp;before the end of last year, 2016, and payments will happen in the future.</p><p>Meanwhile, Unicef issued a statement declaring: &ldquo;As well as generously giving his time, energy and support to help raise awareness and funds for UNICEF&rsquo;s work for children, David Beckham has and is continuing to give significant funds personally to 7 Fund. As with all our donors who give, these details are confidential.</p><p>&ldquo;All our Ambassadors support UNICEF in a voluntary capacity, receiving no fee for their time and commitment, and contribute greatly to UNICEF&rsquo;s work for children in danger around the world.&rdquo;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 20.4px;\\\"><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 17px;\\\"><font color=\\\"#74c0e2\\\"><font face=\\\"Open Sans, skolar, Times, serif\\\"><font style=\\\"font-size: 14pt;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1298&amp;recType=story\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Football Leaks: David Beckham's angry pursuit of a Knighthood</a></font></font></font></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 17px;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1296&amp;recType=story\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><font color=\\\"#74c0e2\\\"><font face=\\\"Open Sans, skolar, Times, serif\\\"><font style=\\\"font-size: 14pt;\\\">Plan revealed to send David Beckham into space</font></font></font></a></p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"bb9c9e65-05bd-4b0e-bc2e-9e4447b5698f\"}]"}, "pk": 1297, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

London. Two weeks before the New Year&rsquo;s Honours list announces future Knights patronised by the Queen of England.</p><p>These luminaries then get to wear the title of &lsquo;Sir&rsquo; or &lsquo;Dame&rsquo; before their name in a mock-up of medieval pageantry.</p><p>But one figure who has yet to achieve this hallowed status is football superstar, charity do-gooder and fashion icon David Beckham.</p><p>This night he is engaged in a long interview on a chat show hosted by <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6pBS62pyN8\\\">Jonathan Ross on UK's ITV.</a></p><p>After thanking Beckham just before the closing titles, Ross wagged his finger in the air to stop the clapping and said &ldquo;One more thing&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;At the end of that goal montage earlier on,&rdquo; said Ross referring to some film clips shown at the start of the show, &ldquo;he [the commentator] said David Beckham, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s scored the goal, he&rsquo;s put us in the World Cup, someone please give this man a knighthood&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now we haven&rsquo;t heard the announcement of the honours this year,&rdquo; Ross continued. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t tipped you a wink or anything?&rdquo;</p><p>A dapper Beckham, in suit and tie, grinned broadly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rdquo;m very honoured and lucky to have what I already have. The OBE [Order of the British Empire, a lesser honour to a Knighthood] I&rsquo;m very proud of. You know, even to be talked about receiving a knighthood is an unbelievable honour, but I&rsquo;m very lucky to have what I have.&rdquo;</p><p>The audience would not have known that he was not nearly so casual about the honour as his words and demeanour suggested.</p><p>Leaked emails show that six months earlier Simon Oliveira, his chief public relations adviser, had requested information about how a letter nominating someone for an honour should be written.</p><p>Indeed, Oliveira had planted Ross&rsquo; pay off. He had emailed the show&rsquo;s producers to inform them the ex-player wanted Ross to say he should be knighted live on air.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe Jonathan should ask him about [the] knighthood and say he should get it,&rdquo; Oliveira wrote. &ldquo;What do you think? David is up for it.&rdquo;</p><p>He even told the show&rsquo;s producers how Beckham would respond with an anecdote about Ross being a jinx because he had predicted that he would play for Britain&rsquo;s Olympic team in their last interview. And, of course, Beckham did exactly that.</p><p>The campaign had been going so well. But over the next two weeks news leaked to Beckham and his advisers that there was a problem.</p><p>Beckham&rsquo;s attempt to become &ldquo;Sir David&rdquo; appears to have&nbsp;been blocked by the UK&rsquo;s tax authorities, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p><p>Like several other celebrities, Beckham and his wife Victoria have been revealed to be part of the Ingenious scheme, a project which could have helped them avoid paying up to &pound;1m of tax by using artificial losses from investments in a range of films. The scheme was being investigated by the HMRC.</p><p>The emails emerged from the bombshell Football Leaks database containing data that includes 18.6 million documents, which was originally handed to the German magazine Der Spiegel. They passed it on to other media partners in the European Investigative Collaborations network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Beckham in his playing days for LA Galaxy in 2007 (Wikimedia commons: Calebrw)\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/David_Beckham_Nov_11_2007%20Credit-%20Calebrw%20(1).jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 313px; opacity: 0.9; width: 400px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&ldquo;Who decides on the honors?? It&rsquo;s a disgrace to be honest\\\"</div><p>Behind the scenes, the facade dropped two days before the 2013 Honours were published and newspapers had cottoned on that Beckham wasn&rsquo;t on the list. &ldquo;You see the knighthood thing today?&rdquo; Beckham enquired of Oliveira at 5.30 AM from his home in Los Angeles after seeing the Sunday papers.</p><p>&ldquo;We half expected it,&rdquo; responded Oliveira from London. &ldquo;Interestingly they&rsquo;re not saying anything negative about you not getting it for financial or other reasons, rather it's a question of timing and the right age.&rdquo;</p><p>It is crucial to 'Brand Beckham&rsquo; - which is thought to have raked in around &pound;45 million in 2015 - that the footballer is presented to the world as a clean cut likeable family man. When asked directly on his previous Ross interview whether he ever used swear words, he replied &ldquo;no never&rdquo;, in keeping with his charming boy next door image.</p><p>However, Oliveira&rsquo;s response was the beginning of a long email expletive-laden outburst from Beckham.</p><p>This article has not corrected the grammar or spelling apart from adding&nbsp;dashes to some of the swear words.</p><p>&ldquo;They r a bunch of c&ndash;ts I expected nothing less,&rdquo; he wrote of the Honours Committee in late December 2013. &ldquo;Who decides on the honors?? It&rsquo;s a disgrace to be honest and if I was American I would of got something like this 10 years ago.&rdquo;</p><p>That morning he had also read that Katherine Jenkins, the classical singer, was about to be given an honour, the Order of the British Empire (OBE). &ldquo;Katherine Jenkins OBE for what?&rdquo;, his email continued. &ldquo;Singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus admiring [sic] to taking coke&hellip; F&ndash;king joke and if you get asked we should think of a cutting remark.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">\\\"We need to remain dignified if asked\\\"</div><p>It was left to Oliveira to patiently point out that the committee was staffed by civil servants, royal officers and MPs, and to point out that the &ldquo;Americans have no real equivalent in place &hellip; it's peculiar to this country.</p><p>&ldquo;My honest advice to you is that we should not do anything that jeopardises it and remain positive... Why waste time on a cutting remark as that will only rile the committee? We need to remain dignified if asked but if you want me to work up something cutting I will work up one but my advice is it&rsquo;s not productive.&rdquo;</p><p>Beckham wrote back: &ldquo;I agree but it's pissed me off those old unappreciative c&ndash;ts.&ldquo; The PR guru then emailed David Gardner, one of Beckham&rsquo;s other close advisers, to reaffirm the knighthood campaign strategy for the following year.</p><p>&ldquo;It just gives us even more reason to work further this year on UNICEF, armed forces, other charitable commitments, etc. Essential&hellip;&rdquo; he concluded.</p><p>However, the following year, the scandal over the Ingenious scheme worsened. In July 2014 Ingenious Media wrote to its 1,300 investors, who also included fellow football stars Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Gary Lineker, and told them to prepare for tax demands totalling at least &pound;520m in an HMRC crackdown.</p><p>Ingenious Media, which ran the scheme, warned they were likely to be asked to repay all the tax they saved, possibly with interest. The day after the story broke, Oliveira emailed Charles Bradbrook, Beckham&rsquo;s accountant, to ask how the ex-footballer would be personally affected.</p><p>Bradbrook stated HMRC&rsquo;s demands for repayment over the Ingenious scheme were &ldquo;a nightmare&rdquo; and complained the tax agency had &ldquo;moved the goalposts dramatically&rdquo;. Despite the bad news, Oliveira pressed ahead with his campaign to get his celebrity client knighted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">Opposing Scottish independence \\\"will play well with&nbsp;establishment\\\"</div><p>In August 2014, the TV historian Dan Snow emailed to ask whether Beckham would support the campaign opposing Scottish independence ahead of the upcoming referendum. Oliveira declared that \\\"clearly the right thing is that we stay together&nbsp;due to our history and because we are stronger\\\" and advised the star that his &ldquo;I also think your support will play well with establishment and in turn help your knighthood.&rdquo;</p><p>Beckham replied: &ldquo;Ok let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo; So Oliveira drafted a plea to the Scottish nation on Beckham&rsquo;s behalf. It read:</p><p>&ldquo;I took as much satisfaction in seeing Sir Chris Hoy or Andy Murray win gold as I did watching Jess Ennis and Mo Farah do the same in the Olympic Stadium. My sincere hope is that you will vote to renew our historic bond, which has been such a success over the centuries and the envy of the entire world. What unites us is much greater than what divides us. Let's stay together. David Beckham.&rdquo;</p><p>Beckham expressed concern the message was &ldquo;not too needy&rdquo; or &ldquo;not too oh please stay with us&rdquo;, but after Oliveira reassured him the statement was released to the media. It did not contain any of Beckham&rsquo;s words. But days before the New Years&rsquo; Honours List was announced, Beckham appeared to have discovered he had been passed over again.</p><p>The issue as to what he missed out seems to have been the Inland Revenue, who &ldquo;place[d] a flag&rdquo; on Beckham's nomination without giving any detail, Oliviera states after alleged discussions with figures connected to the committee.</p><p>&ldquo;Many were disappointed but the inland revenue won. So we now have proof this was true and it happened. Disappointing as the situation wasn't properly explained by them just a flag. These are all things we need to bear in mind now. For example your co investors in Miami, how will that affect things like this[?]&rdquo;</p><p>This was a reference to proposals that a Qatari government-controlled investment fund should invest in a football club Beckham was setting up in Miami. But the ex-footballer was in no mood to let the Honours Committee dictate his choice of investors. &ldquo;Don't give a f&ndash;k anymore I'll decide who my investors are not these c&ndash;ts&hellip; They are f&ndash;king c&ndash;ts&hellip;&rdquo; Beckham replied. &ldquo;I pay taxes and always have done so they have no right to do this&hellip;. C&ndash;ts.&rdquo;</p><p>Oliveira wrote: &ldquo;Genuinely the problem is&hellip;that [HMRC] for the moment they are winning that battle of public opinion. 'People should be paying their way in this country and nasty Starbucks, Google and Gary Barlow profit from this country and give nothing back, blah blah.'</p><p>&ldquo;At the moment I have done a decent job to keep your name away from it and to explain that Ingenious whilst benefitting from tax breaks invested in a number of successful films, companies etc but in the meantime the f&ndash;kers behind the scenes are putting pressure on people like you to settle, this Honours Committee thing a perfect example.&rdquo; Beckham wrote: &ldquo;The flag has no truth behind it as we didn't [do] nothing wrong everything is and was above board &hellip; C&ndash;ts.&rdquo;</p><p>Unfortunately for Beckham, Ingenious continued to hit the headlines. In July 2015, it was announced that several investors had decided to sue the creators of the scheme because of the massive bills they now faced.</p><p>In August last&nbsp;year, HMRC claimed a &ldquo;hands down&rdquo; victory in a tax tribunal judgement over the scheme. But Beckham, apparently, has not given up on his dream. Last year, he was asked to the Premio AS del Deporte awards in Madrid, one of Spanish sport&rsquo;s most renowned honours, to be given the sporting &ldquo;legend&rdquo; prize.</p><p>When Oliveira sent him the invite, Beckham replied: &ldquo;Unless it&rsquo;s a knighthood f&ndash;k off.&rdquo;</p><p>Oliveira wistfully wrote: &ldquo;Then we might need the ghost of Christmas future [as] the ghost of [Christmas] past hasn't worked.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Beckham's representatives and Doyen Sports would not respond to questions raised by this article, but did respons to EIC Partners arguing&nbsp;this is 'stolen material', so did not comment on questions related to facts&nbsp;</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 20.4px;\\\"><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 17px;\\\"><font color=\\\"#74c0e2\\\"><font face=\\\"Open Sans, skolar, Times, serif\\\"><font style=\\\"font-size: 14pt;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1297&amp;recType=story\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Football Leaks: How David Beckham held back from donating to his own Unicef project&nbsp;</a></font></font></font></p><p style=\\\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 17px;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://theblacksea.eu/index.php?idT=88&amp;idC=88&amp;idRec=1296&amp;recType=story\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><font color=\\\"#74c0e2\\\"><font face=\\\"Open Sans, skolar, Times, serif\\\"><font style=\\\"font-size: 14pt;\\\">Plan revealed to send David Beckham into space</font></font></font></a></p></body></html>\", \"alignment\": \"normal\"}, \"id\": \"1a808377-a627-41a6-b31b-0bebf98c9108\"}]"}, "pk": 1298, "model": "blacktail.Story"},

Kosak calls this a &ldquo;human rights violation&rdquo; and adds: &ldquo;Unless we are proved to be illegal or terrorists - no one has a right to say anything about our school.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Turkish Embassy in Bucharest denies&nbsp;any interference. In a statement to us, it outlined: &ldquo;The Embassy doesn&rsquo;t put such pressures or have discussions of this kind with parents. After the attempted coup of July 15, several families wanted to dissociate themselves from any connection with this movement, FET&Ouml;, and have taken the initiative themselves to withdraw their children from these schools. It was and is an independent process: parents do it because they want to.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Kosak says this the school is thriving, as they have 160 new students this year. But the move is difficult for children who are used to one system for up to 16 years and suddenly have to change.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;The parents are really angry, but they can&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They have no other choice. They want to think about their children&rsquo;s future.&rdquo;</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Lumina is closing its Bucharest-based South East Europe University &ldquo;due to pressure&rdquo; from the Turkish authorities on its sponsors, the directors argue. The institution&nbsp;was co-financed by companies from Turkey and Romania. Some of these business owners are now in jail in Turkey, while G&uuml;rsoy adds about the others: &nbsp;&ldquo;[The Embassy] told them they were supporting terrorism by supporting the university.\\\"</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Embassy denies any involvement with the actions of the institution&rsquo;s funders.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&ldquo;There were no such discussions between representatives of the Embassy and the sponsors of the University,&rdquo; it claims.</p><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Without sponsorship, Lumina had to close the university.

One of his recent major investments is in fast loans, where his companies supply small amounts of money to those in desperate need of cash. Their customers often end up repaying the loans at massive interest rates.</p><p>52 year-old Boyko is the 75th wealthiest Russian (according to Forbes), although he has an Italian passport, so enjoys all the rights of an EU citizen. He has hidden his fortune in Cyprus and the Bahamas, and purchased Latvian start-up 4finance in 2011, which provides fast loans with usury interest rates in Europe and America.</p><p>His company paid at least 105 million Euro for shares in this Riga-based business - cash which was distributed through Malta corporate structures to eight Latvian and Russian founders and beneficial owners. These Maltese companies do not appear to have one single employee and pay no significant corporate tax.</p><p>Additionally, in 4finance, which is expanding its fast loans operations to other continents, they established a system of loans to its shareholders with 15 per cent interest, through which the parent company drains the profits of subsidiaries from many European countries where 4finance operates. In this way 4finance Malta Ltd. collected almost 68 million Euro in loan interest between 2013 and 2015 and shifted profits from other countries to Malta, forwarding them to the parent company in Luxembourg.</p><p>Another Maltese company owned by Boyko financed a business operation providing fast loans in the USA with the help of Native American Indian tribes in Montana and Wisconsin with interest rates that can rise over 700 per cent.</p><p>According to Maltese legislation and tax practices, all these untaxed or low-taxed financial transfers are legal. This story reveals how Malta, which currently holds the EU presidency, attracts wealthy people and foreign corporations who want to avoid taxation in their own countries.</p><p>It shows in minute detail how rich people operate behind companies in tax havens - while their customers face ballooning debts that force them to leave their home country to find work to pay back interests on their loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/miliardar-2.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 700px; height: 438px;\\\"></p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">THE CUSTOMER</div><div><p>Romania. Late 2015. Despite only being in his 30s, Daniel* is following a complicated treatment for lymphatic cancer. In theory, Romania offer free medical care to its citizens. In practice, patients have to pay for essential drugs and bribe doctors, nurses and orderlies for medical services. These costs can cripple a family's finances. And Daniel is no exception. He borrowed money from relatives and friends, and took loans out from banks to by drugs to treat his cancer. But now he has run out of options.</p><p>So he turns online. To a fast loans company Zaplo. On TV and on the Internet if offers &ldquo;no interest rate or commission&rdquo; for the first loan. And immediate money transfer. It seems too good to be true.</p><p>Daniel makes a contract online in his wife's name, because she has a better credit history than him. That day in November 2015, 800 RON (175 Euro) flashed up in her account.</p><p>Although Daniel already had cancer, this was when the nightmare began.</p><p>Daniel was hit by bills from every direction and could not pay back the 175 Euro in time. In two months, the amount doubled to 350 Euro. Zaplo customer centers - manned by real people and robot callers - contacted him every day. They sent him emails. Letters. They wanted their money back.</p><p>They reached a deal. He would pay the 350 Euro in two tranches. At first, Daniel paid back the initial amount.</p><p>&ldquo;But after you tie yourself up, you cannot get rid of them,&rdquo; he says now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"Zaplo Romania advert 'Receive Money in your account in 15 minutes.

Daniel says that his family wasn&rsquo;t notified about the trial.</p><p>In late February 2017, the court imposed a foreclosure for 2,647 RON (approx. 585 Euro), which included penalties of 1,598 lei (353 Euro) and commissions - which doesn&rsquo;t mention the sum that was already paid. The effective annual interest rate became 1,988.6 per cent.</p><p>&ldquo;Without any warning, after several months, my wife received a notice from a bailiff that her account would be blocked,&rdquo; Daniel says. The amount they needed to pay also included about 100 Euro for the bailiff. His wife's entire monthly income was frozen, although Romanian law states that, in such cases, only a third of the monthly income is subject to such action. &ldquo;They deprived a family of its food,&rdquo; Daniel argues.</p><p>Meanwhile, he finished the treatment for cancer. To cover his debts, he left to work in Germany.</p><p>&ldquo;I had to leave Romania because of some thieves who deceived me and lied to me,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>He has no money to contest the court decision - and has few hopes his situation will improve. &ldquo;We are poverty-stricken - and they [Zaplo] take advantage of that,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;I pray to God that the cancer will not come back. Because if I relapse, I'll go and kill them [Zaplo]. I'm leaving this life with my hands on their neck.&rdquo;</p><p>Daniel&rsquo;s case is far from singular. Zaplo IFN started to offer fast small loans in Romania in June 2015 and by April 2017 the company was involved in 1,570 cases in Romanian courts against clients - the vast majority foreclosures. The business, it seems, depends on customers not paying their loans back in time.</p><p>Other Romanian clients told us the same story of ballooning interest rates after the first month. Take 62 year-old Ana Kosa. She needed 132 Euro to cover basic expenses to supplement her 88 Euro a month pension. After failing to pay back the amount after 30 days, the costs swelled to 308 Euro, forcing the pensioner to move to Austria to work as an elderly carer.</p><p>&ldquo;They [Zaplo] kept calling me and saying they will come to recover the amount,&ldquo; she says. &ldquo;But for 1,400 lei (308 Euro) what can they take from me?&rdquo;</p><p>Romanian lawyer Adrian Cuculis says clients of fast loans constitute one third of his cases - a number in the high hundreds.</p><p>But Zaplo seems to be operating in a grey area.</p><p>&ldquo;The Romanian authorities have minimum information about companies such as Zaplo,&rdquo; he adds.</p><p>Zaplo IFN is not a standalone Romanian company. It is subsidiary of Latvian based AS 4finance which operates in 17 European and American countries.</p><p>Interest rates can increase to even 2,000 per cent per year. This has caught the attention of consumer protection agencies.</p><p>In 2016, the Finnish Consumer Ombudsman applied for an injunction on a 4finance subsidiary on the grounds of unlawful credit granting practices - stating that a 2,010 Euro credit could balloon into 4,145 Euro in six months due to late payments.</p><p>In 2015, the Lithuanian central bank has accused a 4finance subsidiary of multiple legal violations, and in Denmark, 4Finance subsidiary Vivus violated Danish marketing laws by stating on the website that the interest rate on a loan was 19 per cent. According to the Danish consumer ombudsman, the correct figure would have been 730.1 per cent. This year Vivus accepted to pay a fine of about 40,000 Euro.</p><p>But while it preys on vulnerable citizens across the continent, its former and current owners are using tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg, Cyprus, Panama and Bahamas. One of the most important tax friendly country for beneficial owners who profits on poor European citizens with fast loans is - Malta.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">THE FAT CATS OF MALTA</div></div><div><p>&ldquo;A Fat Cat is a smug, selfish and greedy businessman who exploits their position for their own personal gain at the cost of the businesses or community,&rdquo; states the English Urban dictionary.</p><p>Yet owners of 4finance who are hidden behind Malta companies seem so confident in their business operations that they named the company through which they funnel more than 100 million Euro to their bank accounts without any significant tax paid as&hellip; Fatcat Investments Limited. They could hardly find a better word to define an unregulated business run across two continents.</p><p>However, their marketing description of their services is more polished: &ldquo;Smart lending made simple. 4finance is a global leader in digital consumer finance. We get money to you in a fast, convenient way that fits your lifestyle,&rdquo; says their website.</p><p>4finance claims to be &ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s largest and fastest growing online and mobile consumer lending group&rdquo;. Its method is to supply loans &ldquo;quickly, conveniently and responsibly&rdquo;. Since establishing in 2008, it has provided more than 11.5 million Single Payment, Line of Credit and Installment Loans totalling over 4.0 billion Euro.</p><p>However, dozens of millions of Euro in profits are collected with usurious interests rates on small loans. These are given to the poorest European citizens who then struggle with an army of lawyers to repay debts with interests rates which sometimes exceeded many hundreds percents annual rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/miliardar-1%20(1).jpg\\\" style=\\\"width: 700px; height: 438px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Current owners of 4finance, Russian billionaire Oleg Boyko and his Latvian partners, enjoy a lavish and luxury lifestyle in contrast to his clients, who are usually the working poor, captured by the marketing trap of a fast small loan.</p><p>With an estimated wealth of 1.2 billion USD, Oleg Viktorovich Boiko is the 75th most wealthy Russian, according to Forbes. He is an owner of global private investment group Finstar Financial, which had two billion US dollars assets under its management in 2016. Its CEO is Nicholas Jordan, formerly of Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and UBS.</p><p>Boyko&rsquo;s Ritzio International gambling group operates more than 150 gambling clubs in countries such as Germany, Italy, Romania and Croatia. Besides Russian citizenship, Boyko obtained an Italian passport in February 2008, and is a European Union citizen. Through the British Virgin Islands company FTV BVI Ltd, Boyko co-owns the Fashion TV channel, which reaches hundreds of millions of viewers in more than 140 countries all over the world.</p><p>He remains a close friend of top Russian billionaires Roman Abramovich, Alisher Usmanov and Suleiman Kerimov and first deputy Prime Minister of Russia Igor Shuvalov.</p><p>During summers, when he is not at his luxury villa in Blevio at Lake Como in Italy, he rides the 45-meter long Blade, one of the fastest yachts in the world with a speed of 44 knots. A recent passion is Hollywood films. He co-produced Frank Miller&rsquo;s Sin City: A Dame to Kill For and it has been announced that he is co-producing the directorial debut of 'Lost in Translation' and 'The Avengers' actor Scarlett Johansson - Summer Crossing.</p><p>4finance group, which purchased TBI bank in Bulgaria in 2016, is not his only lending company. In 2016 Boyko purchased a 51 per cent share in Spanish Prestamos Prima &ndash; through another Maltese company Allectica Limited. In the same year he invested 31.5 million in Berlin-based internet lending platform Spotcap, which provides small fast loans to small end medium enterprises in at least five countries from Netherlands and UK to New Zealand.

In February 2008 four Latvian school-friends from the elite Stockholm School of Economics in the capital Riga founded a start-up, AS OC Finances. The men were Alberts Pole, Kristaps Ozols, M&#257;ris Kei&scaron;s and Aigars Kesenfeld. All young and smart. Their company was a great success among the new Baltic enterprises. The business model - providing small loans to customers via their internet platform, text messages and phone calls - attracted many customers. It seemed they had invented a money-making machine.</p><p>Then Latvian businessmen connected to the local political and business elite - Uldis Arnicans, Edgar Dupats, Maris Martinson and Russian citizen Ilya Nikulin - joined the four founders and school-friends on 15 December 2009 as shareholders. Together they founded joint parent holding company in Malta and named it Fatcat Investments Limited. The new investors took the majority shares and decisive roles in the start-up.</p><p>These four new shareholders were close to Latvia's power elite. Young lawyer Edgars Dupats in 2014 married the daughter of former Latvian prime minister Andris Skele, a local ex-oligarch with a reputation similar to Silvio Berlusconi. Also Uldis Arnicans is a well-known businessman connected with one of Skele&rsquo;s family business. Both Dupats and Arnicans have remained, alongside Boyko, as shareholders of Tirona Limited, the main owner of 4finance group as we went to press. On the other hand, the real-estate businessman Maris Martinsons has been involved in a major corruption scandal and criminal investigations. The fourth new shareholder, Ilya Nikulin, is a professional Russian ice hockey player in Moscow.</p><p>Their company was renamed AS 4Finance in September 2011. However, until 9 December 2011, all eight shareholders of Malta&rsquo;s Fatcat Investment Ltd were additionally hidden behind seven &ldquo;international business companies&rdquo; registered at the same address in the Central American offshore jurisdiction of Belize, plus one company registered in another European tax haven, Cyprus.</p><p>Kristaps Ozols was hidden behind Estimate Investing Limited, Alberts Pole behind Sommer Invest Limited, Maris Keiss was owner of Summit Finance Limited, Aigars Kesenfelds of Walsden Invest Limited. Besides the four founders, the four new shareholders were well disguised. Edgars Dupats owned Verveks Invest Limited, Uldis Arnicans Wealth Investments Limited, and Maris Martinson was hidden behind Prosperity Financing Limited. All seven companies were registered at the same address Withfield Tower, Third Floor, 4792 Coney Drive, P.O. Box 1777, Belize City, Belize. The eighth shareholder Ilya Nikulin was behind Cyprus based company V.C. Vertice Consulting Limited.</p><p>The first report that local politicians and businessmen were connected with 4finance was broadcast on Latvian TV program &ldquo;De Facto&rdquo; in February 2013. They showed information that Dupats, Arnicans, Martinsons and politician Andris Ameriks were giving loans to 4finance. But there was no information in the public domain that Dupats, Arnicans and Martinsons were also the ultimate beneficial owners. Only the politician Ameriks said that in 2010 he gave a 500,000 Euro loan to local guys who established that company. Dupats, on the other hand, told the media that, as a lawyer, he was a Fatcat Investments representative in a 4finance shareholders meeting, but didn&rsquo;t reveal that he was also one of the beneficial owners hidden behind the Maltese company.</p><p>As they were hidden behind companies in Belize, it seemed impossible for the media and local tax authorities to determine their shares and involvement in this profitable but usurious business.</p><p>But in December 2011 seven beneficial owners became owners of new Maltese companies which replaced the Belize companies as shareholders of Fatcat Investments Limited. The majority shareholders, with 19.5 per cent shares each, were Uldis Arnicans behind G-Interactive Limited, Aigars Kesenfelds with ABS Holding Limited, Maris Martinson behind Nessa Limited and Ilya Nikulin with Cyprus company V.C. Vertice Consulting Limited. Seven per cent of the shares were held by Edgars Dupats in Mercalia Partners Limited, while three founders Alberts Pole, Maris Keiss and Kristaps Ozols retained five per cent of shares in companies AJG Partners Limited, VS Ventures Limited and LVS Limited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">TAKING FAST LOANS TO NEW LEAGUE: ENTER BOYKO</div><p>December 2011 was an important month as the Latvians were about to become quite rich. Russian billionaire Oleg Boyko decided to purchase a majority 75 per cent share in their perspective fast loans start-up, which had subsidiaries only in Lithuania, Sweden, Finland and Denmark at this time.</p></div><div><p>According to &ldquo;Share purchase agreement in relation to AS 4finance&rdquo;, dated 21 December 2011, Boyko&rsquo;s Tirona Limited paid 55 million Euro to Fatcat Investments Limited for the purchase of the 75 per cent shares of fast loans company AS 4finance, with its headquarters in Riga, Latvia. The first tranche, worth 12 million, was paid a few days after the conclusion of the deal.</p><p>Due to the first tranche of Boyko&rsquo;s payment to Fatcat Investments Ltd, its profit in 2011 skyrocketed to 26 million Euro before taxes. According to Fatcat's &ldquo;Report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011&rdquo; the company's profits increased significantly compared to the previous year. If they had 4.2 million Euro profit in 2010 from fast loans operations in five countries, they reached almost 14 million Euro profits for the same business operations in 2011 with only 92 employees. But Boyko&rsquo;s first tranche in the sum of 12 million Euro raised profits of Fatcat Investments even higher, to 26 million Euro before taxes.</p><p>&ldquo;The substantial increase in the profit resulting in the year under review is attributed to the transfer of the first tranche,&rdquo; said a report, referring to Boyko&rsquo;s first 12 million Euro for the purchase of majority shares in the company AS 4finance.</p><p>Effective taxation in Malta for Fatcat Investments was quite low for European standards. The company had 26 million Euro in profits and paid two million Euro taxes that year, which represented seven per cent.</p><p>In 2011, the Latvian shareholders of Fatcat didn&rsquo;t pay themselves any dividends, nor in 2012, when an additional 43 million Euro from Boyko&rsquo;s Tirona Limited company was transferred to Maltese bank accounts. &ldquo;The company&rsquo;s profits were derived from a gain on a sale of a subsidiary and interest received to its participating parties,&rdquo; Fatcat&rsquo;s annual report for 2012 says. Ownership in the major AS 4finance company was then shared by 75 per cent of Tirona Limited and 25 per cent of Fatcat Investments Ltd.</p><p>The Latvian shareholders enjoyed the benefits of the Maltese taxation system. For the year 2012, when Fatcat reached 43 million Euro in profits, the company paid only 366,762 Euro taxes on profits, which represents 0.7 per cent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">HOW MALTA FAVOURS THE RICH</div></div><div><p>Malta charges companies at the highest rate of income tax - 35 per cent - on their profits. But if the company's activities and shareholders are mainly based abroad, they have a refundable tax credit mechanism that results in a significantly reduced tax rate on income or gains that can go as low as five per cent. Additionally, in Malta there is no withholding tax on dividends, interests and royalties. And Maltese tax on capital gains for non-residents, which should include Boyko&rsquo;s purchase of shares in 4finance, is a whopping zero per cent.</p><p>After restructuring, Fatcat Investments Ltd. remained a vehicle for collection and non-taxable distribution of dozens of millions of Euro to Latvian businessmen.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"-\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/2%20graphic.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 756px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A major event came in July and December 2013. In the summer, Fatcat Investments distributed 57 million Euro of &ldquo;interim dividends&rdquo; to all eight companies owned by seven Latvian businessmen and the Russian hockey player. But that is not all. After renaming Fatcat company into FCI Investments Ltd in autumn, the company received a further 51.6 million Euro from Boyko&rsquo;s Tirona Ltd for the remaining 25 per cent shares in AS 4finance.</p><p>This is confirmed by an &ldquo;option deed&rdquo; signed by Tirona Ltd and ultimate beneficial owners of Maltese companies on 3 December 2013.</p><p>With remaining incomes from dividends (three million Euro) and interests (2.7 million Euro), the company reached profits in the sum of 56.7 million Euro and paid its shareholders additional dividends on the 1 January 2014 in an additional sum of 57 million Euro.</p><p>Shareholders therefore received 114 million Euro of dividends in only half a year. But by using many tax optimization and avoidance schemes they paid almost next to zero taxes.</p><p>How did they manage to funnel money out of Malta jurisdiction to local companies and personal bank accounts? The answer is simple: with shareholder loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">CHAINS OF SHAREHOLDER LOANS AND LESS THAN ONE PER CENT TAX</div></div><div><p>We will focus on the distribution of millions from the second December 2013 payout, but the methods of distribution were the same as in July 2013.</p><p>As reveals &ldquo;FCI Investments Limited trial balance as at 31 December 2013&rdquo; shareholder loans worth 57.7 million Euro were given by parent holding company FCI Investments Ltd (former Fatcat Investments Ltd) to its shareholders in December 2013. Two major shareholders Aldis Arnicans (G-Interactive Limited) and Aigars Kesenfelds (ABS Holding Limited) received loans amounting to 18.4 million Euro each. These were calculated at the same percentage as their shares in the company &ndash; 31.97 per cent. Edgars Dupats (Mercalia Partners Limited) received 6.6 million Euro of shareholder loans or 11.48 per cent and the remaining three founders Alberts Pole (AJG Partners Limited), Maris Keiss (VS Ventures Limited) and Kristaps Ozols (LVS Limited) received 4.7 million Euro each for their 8.2 per cent shares.</p><p>And what happened to other two major shareholders Maris Martinsons (Nessa Limited) and Ilya Nikulin (V.C. Vertice Consulting Limited) who had 19.5 per cent of shares each? According to an option deed signed on 3 December 2013 between Boyko&rsquo;s Tirona Limited and sellers of the remaining 25 per cent shares in 4finance, its outgoing shareholders planned to sell shares to the remaining shareholders in two stages.</p><p>During the first stage, Martinsons and Nikulin left the company in December 2013. For their shares, the remaining six shareholders paid Martinsons&rsquo;s Nessa Limited 13.4 million Euro and 11.3 million Euro to Nikulin&rsquo;s Cyprus based V.C. Vertice Consulting Limited.</p><p>The second stage happened on 15 October 2014, when the companies of the three founders Alberts Pole, Maris Keiss and Kristaps Ozols left the shareholder structure of FCI Investments Limited. According to a &ldquo;Share purchase agreement&rdquo; the aggregate price for shares of all three companies was only 32,950 Euro.</p><p>But let's return to the shareholder loans worth 57 million Euro given in December 2013. Soon after the option premium deed was signed and Boyko&rsquo;s Tirona transferred 44.5 million Euro in cash to FCI Investments Ltd and the remaining sum was paid by 7.8 million Euro worth of bonds, the main parent company FCI Investments Ltd started to wire cash to its Latvian shareholders.</p><p>On 12 December 2013, when Martinson and Nikulin received their millions, also Aigars Kesenfelds, for example, received 14.7 million Euro of cash to the bank account of his ABS Holding Limited opened at Sparkasse Bank Malta plc. Uldis Arnicans received 11.7 million Euro in his G-Interactive Ltd account opened in the same bank. Other shareholders received correspondingly smaller sums of cash.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><p><img alt=\\\"-\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Graphic%203.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 905px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to the signed financial statements for 2013, FCI Investment Limited paid only 512,501 Euro in taxes in Malta that year. It had 57 million Euro profits before taxation and 106 million Euro of &ldquo;net cash flow from financing activities&rdquo; that year. Therefore they paid only 0.9 per cent of taxes on profits. This is only tax on money released for dividends' distribution in July 2013. The distribution of an additional 57 million Euro of dividends from December 2013 was transferred into the following accounting year &ndash; on 1 January 2014.</p><p>This is a date when many interesting business events happened. On 1 January 2014 shareholders signed set-off agreements with FCI Investments. Uldis Arnicans&rsquo;s G-Interactive Ltd., for example signed an agreement whereby its 18.4 million Euro shareholder loan was set-off with 18.2 million Euro of dividends. In this way his loan to FCI Investments was almost fully repaid overnight and, after this operation, he owed only 209,981 Euro to parent FCI company. Exactly the same numbers were also implemented in Aigars Kesenfelds&rsquo;s ABS Holding Ltd. case. Other beneficial owners set-off their shareholders loans with dividends with appropriately smaller sums on the very same date &ndash; 1 January 2014.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"-\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Graphic%204.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 808px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><div><p>But this date is also important due to another document &ndash; the claim for refund &ndash; sent by the director of G-Interactive Ltd Ivan Vella to the Maltese Inland Revenue Department &ndash; International Taxation Unit, revealing that shareholders reported a much smaller sum of received dividends to Maltese authorities.</p><p>As said, on 1 January 2014, G-Interactive received more than 18 million Euro in dividends. Also &ldquo;G-Interactive accounts for the year ending 31 December 2014&rdquo; reveals in this year it has 18.6 million Euro described as dividend income in its accounting books.</p><p>However, when they decided to use the advantageous Maltese tax system - which offers also two-thirds refund of tax paid on dividends and thus lowering it from 15 to five per cent, Ivan Vella reported the different number.</p><p>In a tax refund claim dated 17 October 2014 there is no sign of the 18 million Euro dividends paid on 1 January 2014. Instead, on the same date, a much smaller sum is reported to Maltese tax authority &ndash; only 1.09 million Euro of gross dividends. Of this sum, the company paid 163,804 Euro in taxes - 15 per cent - and received ten per cent back or 109,203 Euro of refunds from the Maltese tax authority. Therefore, it paid only 54,601 Euro or five per cent of the declared sum.</p><p>Dividends received on 1 January 2014 from FCI Investments Ltd through shareholder loans were, according to this set-off agreement, worth 18.2 million Euro. Therefore G-Interactive Limited paid only 0.3 per cent tax on this dividend income.</p><p>According to a Maltese accountant, who wishes to remain anonymous, this is fully legal, thanks to an agreement to avoid double taxation signed between Malta and Cyprus in 1994 and the fact that capital gains of foreign residents are not taxed in Malta.</p><p>Because of this loophole, for example, at least 40.7 million Euro of Boyko&rsquo;s Cyprus based Tirona Limited paid in cash to Fatcat Investments in 2012 for shares in 4finance are &ldquo;exempt income&rdquo; and thus without any taxation in Malta. This is confirmed by the Income Tax Return of FCI Investments Ltd filed on 8 August 2013, which reveals other tax exemptions on foreign incomes worth additional million Euro.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">FUNNELLING MILLIONS FROM MALTA TO LATVIA</div></div><div><p>Maltese companies with Latvian beneficial owners who received more than 100 million Euro from Boyko were bursting with cash. They needed to transfer their millions somehow to Latvia or use it for new investments. And, of course, pay as little tax as possible during this process.</p><p>The solution was again found in shareholder loans. There were dozens of shareholders loans given from Maltese companies to Latvian companies owned by the same shareholders. For example, G-Interactive Ltd loaned two million Euro on 18 March 2014 to Latvian company SIA ZOL28, represented by Uldis Arnicans, who is also a tax resident of Monaco, which has zero per cent tax on foreign personal income.</p><p>On the same date in March 2014 his company G-Interactive loaned an additional two million Euro to the company SIA UG-70, again represented by Arnicans. Three days later, on 21 March 2014, his company loaned 3.5 million Euro, to Luxembourg 4finance Holdings S.A.</p><p>According to the accounting books, Arnicans received at least 1.5 million Euro in loans from G-Interactive personally to his bank accounts in 2014. In that year G-Interactive reached 12.3 million Euro in profit and paid only 266,382 Euro in taxes - or two per cent.</p><p>Most interesting is that in July 2015 Arnicans started the liquidation of G-Interactive, which ended in September 2015. In this process he assigned all loans, given by G-Interactive to other companies, to himself personally, so many other entities and companies later needed to return these loans directly to his personal bank accounts. Loan proceeds are not taxed anywhere. Only interests are usually subject to taxation.</p><div>&nbsp;</div></div><p><img alt=\\\"-\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/5_edited.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 695px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><p>The second major shareholder Aigars Kesenfelds, who received the same amount of 18 million Euro from FCI Investments to ABS Holdings, opted for other methods. He decided to finance new investments and start-ups.</p><p>For example, ABS Holdings gave a credit line worth 2.5 million Euro to Lithuanian company UAB Mogo in April 2014. This is one of the subsidiaries of start-up Mogo Finance, which focuses on car leasing (hire-purchase) and was founded in 2012 in Latvia. Kesenfelds invested in this company also in 2012 and 2013.</p><p>In Spring 2014 ABS Holding gave loans to other companies, including Dotcom Enterprises (4.5 million Euro), Dyonne Trading (3.1 million Euro), SIA Daugalas Iela (850,000 Euro) and many others.</p><p>All these proceeds initially paid by Boyko&rsquo;s Cyprus company for share in 4finance were taxed according to Maltese standards. In 2013, for example, ABS Holdings reached 12.3 million Euro in profits and paid 576,000 Euro or 4.6 per cent of taxes in Malta.</p><p>The remaining Latvian shareholders of FCI Investments tried to get money from Malta to their own bank accounts or invest it further in a similar way.</p><p>Malta's lax taxation and exemptions on capital gains tax allowed more than 100 million Euro paid by Boyko for shares in fast loans company 4finance to be distributed to Latvian beneficiaries almost without any tax paid.</p><p>When EIC Network asked the Latvian and Russian shareholders of the Maltese Fatcat Investment Ltd how much tax they paid and in which jurisdiction, no one replied except Edgars Dupats, who remains, with Oleg Boyko, a partner in Tirona Limited.</p><p>&ldquo;The undertakings of private business companies, including those with my participation and shareholder status, are supervised and audited in line with the laws of respective jurisdiction and best industry practice,&rdquo; says Dupats.</p><p>&ldquo;Regarding your questions on holdings in other jurisdictions, the need to establish a legal entity in a particular jurisdiction arises from business requirements of its shareholders. Given the fact that the particular jurisdiction of Malta operates under the Common Law, such [a] legal structure allows [us] to secure fast and quality resolutions of any shareholder disputes.&rdquo;</p><p>No Fatcat shareholder responded to questions regarding whether they owned a company in Belize. Neither did they respond to phonecalls. Oleg Boyko and the director of Tirona Limited, Andreus Loucas, as well as 4finance, and Zaplo Romania didn't answer to questions sent by EIC Network.</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">15 PER CENT INTERCOMPANY LOANS FOR SHIFTING PROFITS TO MALTA</div></div><div><p>Latvian beneficial owners who sold their shares gained significantly from this Maltese taxation scheme. But how well did this perform for Oleg Boyko, who invested large amounts of money into the dynamic and profitable fast loans business?</p><p>He soon established full control over 4finance group, liquidated FCI Investments, and now - with the assistance of two Latvians Uldis Arnicans and Edgar Dupats - controls the whole group through Tirona Limited (Cyprus). Boyko is hidden in the company structure behind his 75-year old relative Vera Boyko, who is the beneficial owner of 49 per cent shares of the Cyprus company, which is controlled by nominee shareholder and director Loucas Andreou. The remaining 51 per cent is distributed equally between his partners Arnicans (25.5 per cent) and Dupats (25.5 per cent), both connected to the influential Latvian Skele family.</p><p>After he took control of the fast loans company, Boyko immediately restructured it, set up a 4finance Holding S.A. in Luxembourg and started issuing bonds which financed the expansion of fast loans operations in subsidiaries in more than 17 countries. The first issuance of bonds by Latvian AS 4finance was in July 2013, when they issued 170 million USD in senior notes with 13 per cent interest rates on the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) in Dublin. In August 2014 the Luxembourg based 4Finance S.A. started to issue bonds. First they managed to sell senior notes on the Irish stock exchange worth 68 million USD with 11.75 per cent interest rates. A year later, in August 2015, it issued 375 million Swedish kronas with 11.75 per cent interest rate in Stockholm. And finally, in 2016 they sold 150 million Euro senior notes on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with 11.25 per cent interest rates.</p><p>With billionaire Boyko at the helm, fast loans became a big business. He expanded operations of 4finance to the Americas and the Caucasus. However, high interest rates for issued bonds demanded also high interest rates in shareholder loans between the parent company and subsidiaries, which were providing dozens of thousands of small loans in many countries. Parent 4finance company needed high enough interest income to finance repayments of bonds issued at high interest rates.</p><p>A solution was again found in Malta with its lax taxation system. 4finance S.A. Luxembourg branch founded its Maltese branch 4finance Malta Ltd in January 2013 and transferred the majority of its loans to the new company. This is confirmed by a request to open a bank account in Malta which describes: &ldquo;4finance Malta is branch of 4finance S.A. who is providing finance to the group companies. 4finance S.A. has allocated the responsibility for the administration of each loan to the Malta Branch.&rdquo;</p><p>Additionally, a 4a finance group chart, dated April 2013, reveals that the Luxembourg company is providing loans to affiliates in different countries and then attributing loan receivables to the Malta branch, where interests from different countries are collected. &ldquo;It is estimated that 4finance S.A. shall issue loan facilities to the 4finance OpCo&rsquo;s within the following 12 months comprising to EUR 100-130 mio in total,&rdquo; they declared. &ldquo;It is estimated that the income flow from interest payments received by Malta branch within the following 12 months shall comprise to EUR 15-20 million.&rdquo;</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"-\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/graphic%206_edit.jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 788px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><p>According to the spreadsheet &ldquo;Lux_Interest_30112015&rdquo; many shareholders' intercompany loans given to local subsidiaries between 2013 and 2015 have 13.75 per cent or even 15 per cent annual interest rates.</p><p>This might be problematic if local tax authorities inspect the subsidiary company, as these shareholders loans could be significantly higher than similar loans available on the local market over a specific time. In this case such high interest shareholder loans could be an unjustifiable transfer of money from a local subsidiary to a parent company.</p><p>Therefore, the Malta 4finance branch - without a single employee - managed to collect at least 45 million Euro of interest between 2013 and 2015 from the 4finance subsidiaries of 21 countries.</p><p>This spreadsheet reveals it collected 17 million Euro of interest on loans given to five Latvian companies, including the main AS 4finance. Further, they managed to funnel 6.4 million Euro in the form of interests from Poland, 4.3 million Euro from Spain, 3.4 million Euro from Sweden, 2.3 million Euro from Finland and 1.5 million Euro from Denmark. From their neighbouring Lithuania they transferred to Malta four million Euro in the form of interests and two million Euro from Georgia. Other countries lost a smaller part of profits, which were shifted to the Malta branch.</p><p>According to documents, a significant amount of interest was collected on 3 December 2015 by 4finance Malta and paid by many subsidiaries to the Luxembourg-based 4Finance S.A. bank account opened at the Maltese-based IIG bank.</p><p>A financial report from the Malta branch for 2013 reveals the company had loan receivables worth 98 million Euro at the end of that year. All loans except one had a 15 per cent annual interest rate, with only the Georgian branch showing a 20 per cent interest. 4finance Malta branch therefore collected 8.6 million Euro of interest, but its declared profit was lowered by a 6.6 million Euro impairment, therefore it was only 1.4 million Euro. In 2013, the company paid only 12,774 Euro taxes or 0.9 per cent.</p><p>Both receivables and interest income increased significantly in 2014 and 2015. Annual accounts reveal that in 2014, the Malta branch received 24.9 million Euro interest income from other 4finance subsidiaries and 34.2 million Euro in 2015. The Malta branch of 4finance collected 67.9 million Euro of interest between 2013 and 2015 from many European countries.</p><p>Malta thus seems to be quite a suitable vehicle for a financial service where dozens of million of Euro of interest are funnelled from 4finance subsidiaries all over Europe and transferred to a Luxembourg parent company with next to zero taxes.</p><p>4Finance did not reply to comments on this issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\">USA: THE NATIVE AMERICAN LOOPHOLE</div></div><div><p>Among the subsidiaries who were paying high interest rate inter-company loans to the Malta branch was a US-based company, 4finance US Holding Inc., registered in another tax haven in Delaware. On 24 September 2015 it made a repayment of a loan worth 12 million dollars and, on 3 December 2015, it needed to pay 347,649 US dollars of interest on 15 per cent and 13.75 per cent loans to the Malta branch.</p><p>Official operations of 4finance in the United States of America were started only twelve days later, on 15 December 2015, through its subsidiary Zaplo. However, a few years before, 4finance and Boyko&rsquo;s Tirona Limited covertly financed fast loans to US citizens with the assistance of Native American tribes.</p><p>The 4finance prospectus for the Irish Stock Exchange dated July 2013 reveals the following information: &ldquo;In the United States 4finance Group provides certain management services to the United States company North Star Finance, LLC that advances Single Payment Loans on the United States market.&rdquo; And added: &ldquo;4finance Group does not offer loans in the United States but instead provides management and administration of Single Payment Loans services to North Star Finance, LLC, a company wholly owned by GVA Holdings LLC, a subdivision of the Fort Belknap Native American Indian community of Montana, in the United States through its Canada based company, Vivus Servicing Ltd.&rdquo;</p><p>However, available documentation shows that both Latvian 4finance main company and Boyko&rsquo;s Tirona Limited have covertly financed fast loans operations connected to two Native American tribes since 2012.</p><p>For this reason the Maltese company GMLA Trading Limited was incorporated on 1 December 2012. After Boyko purchased 75 per cent of 4finance in 2011, he later received the same shares in this secret company GMLA Trading. The remaining 25 per cent was owned by his Latvian partners through Fatcat/FCI Investments. By December 2013 Boyko owned all shares of GMLA Trading.</p><p>As beneficial owner Boyko is hidden behind a few layers of companies. GMLA Trading Limited, registered in Malta, is owned by Fatima Ventures Ltd from Nassau, Bahamas.</p><p>A director of the Bahamas company is Cypriot Ellada Pozidou, who is also director of Bahamas based, NG Consulting Limited. Behind this company is Daria Kozlova from Feldmans Management (Overseas) Limited, a person mentioned at the beginning of this article, who takes care of Boyko's wealth. This time she is a nominee of D&amp;M Global Holdings, also based in Bahamas. And at the final end of this covert structure lies Tirona Limited with Cypriot director Loucas Andreou. He is also the nominee for Boyko&rsquo;s relative Vera as beneficial owner of 49 per cent of Tirona, the other two partners with 25 per cent are Latvians Uldis Arnicans and Edgars Dupats.</p><p>But why is such secrecy needed? A reason is hidden in spreadsheet titled &ldquo;Interest workings March 2014&rdquo;, which reveals all the loans received and given by GMLA Trading Ltd.</p><p>On 20 August 2012 Latvian AS 4finance borrowed the first tranche of 3.6 million US dollars loan with 13 per cent interests to GMLA Trading with a goal to finance fast loans in the USA. By 30 December 2012, the Latvian company received back all loan repayment and also 76,952 dollars of interest.</p><p>Much bigger interest incomes was made by Tirona Limited, well hidden as a related company behind a Bahamas structure mentioned above. A credit line in the sum of 30 million USD was opened for GMLA Trading on 1 January 2012 and it had a 12 per cent interest rate until 31 December 2012. From this date until 30 March 2014 it charged a higher 15 per cent interest rate per year. In this way Boyko&rsquo;s Tirona managed to receive a significant sum out of GMLA Trading in the form of interest.</p><p>The source of money for paying these interests were two loans from GMLA Trading. The first credit line, worth a maximum of 20 million dollars with a 15 per cent interest rate, was given to Montana based North Star Finance LLC in August 2012. Until the end of March 2014, the US company needed to pay 2.1 million USD in interests to GMLA. In reality they paid 1.2 million USD interest.</p><p>The second credit line, worth a maximum of 20 million dollars, was given to the company Niiwin LLC on 26 September 2013, with a lower interest rate of 10.25 per cent. Niiwin LLC is a company based in Wisconsin and connected to the Chippewa Indian tribe of Lac du Flambeau. Calculations of interest in this part of spreadsheet were not finished. But the loan amount given by GMLA Trading to Niiwin LLC reached six million dollars in March 2014 and 51,634 dollars monthly interest.</p><p>Annual reports for 2012, 2013 and 2014 confirm that GMLA Trading Limited is just a vehicle for the transfer of interest paid by US citizens on fast or payday loans to Boyko's Tirona Limited. In 2012 GMLA Trading received 78,541 Euro from US companies and paid 77,396 Euro to Tirona. There were 1,145 Euro in profits. In 2013 interest revenues from the US were significantly higher at 1.2 million Euro and 1.28 million Euro, which were transferred to Tirona. GMLA faced minus 105,238 Euro in losses that year. In the next year, 2014, interest income was even higher at 1.89 million Euro and they forwarded 2.27 million Euro with 282,176 Euro in losses.</p><p>Through this vehicle, they created losses in the Malta-based company. And where there are losses, there cannot be any tax on profit.</p><p>Altogether Boyko's Tirona Limited received untaxed amounts of 3.2 million Euro of interest from its US clients between 2012 and 2014.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=\\\"-\\\" src=\\\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/Graphic%2072).jpg\\\" style=\\\"height: 924px; width: 600px;\\\"></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><div class=\\\"subtitleArticle\\\" id=\\\"does_the_same_web_design_mean_the_same_company\\\">SAME WEB DESIGN: SAME COMPANY?</div><div><p>It is interesting to compare the websites&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.northcash.com/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" title=\\\"http://www.northcash.com\\\">www.northcash.com</a>, owned by North Star Finance, LLC from Montana and&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.lendgreen.com/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" title=\\\"http://www.lendgreen.com\\\">www.lendgreen.com</a>, owned by Niiwin LLC from Wisconsin.

Lendgreen loans are designed to assist you in meeting your short term borrowing needs and are not intended to be a long term financial solution. The Annual Percentage Rate (&ldquo;APR&rdquo;) as applied to your loan will range from 720% to 795% depending on your payment schedule, pay frequency, loan term, and the amount of your loan,&rdquo; Landgreen's website reveals.</p><p>Both Wisconsin-based Landgreen (Niiwin LLC) and Montana-based Northcash (North Star Finance LLC) operate in the entire USA except ten federal states and among military personnel. &ldquo;Northcash does not lend to residents of Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, or to members of the military or their dependents,&rdquo; the Montana company website says.</p><p>In March 2017 the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) published complaints it received about some online lenders including North Star LLC, which is based in the nearby federal state of Montana. But it couldn't do anything.</p><p>&ldquo;It appears that these companies may be operating as online tribal payday lending companies. These companies assert ownership by the Fort Belknap Indian Community, a federally-recognized Indian Tribe. These companies are not licensed by DFI and are not registered to conduct business in Washington State by the Department of Licensing, the Department of Revenue, or the Secretary of State,&rdquo; they explained.</p><p>Millions of dollars in loans from Maltese covert company also passed also other US states. For example, Niiwin LLC received its new loan from GMLA Trading Ltd in January 2015 through First Century Bank N.A. branch, based in Georgia - where payday lending is a felony.</p><p>Neither Native American tribe Niiwin LLC or North Star Finance LLC responded to questions on why they took such a high interest loan from a Maltese company owned by Russian billionaire. The directors of GMLA Trading Ltd, Tirona Limited and their major beneficial owner Oleg Boyko would not respond to written questions.</p><p>All these Maltese structures would not be possible without the services of Maltese-based Credence Corporate and Advisory, shortened to Credence, which is tightly connected to law company Muscat Azzopardi &amp; Associates. The latter was founded in 1971 by former UN judge in Kosovo Godwin Muscat Azzopardi, while his sons James and Adrian Muscat Azzopardi later founded Credence with partners Andrew Cefai, Claudio Tonolla and Ivan Vella.</p><p>All these persons above mentioned were nominee directors in corporate structure owned by Boyko and his Latvian partners, who managed to funnel through Malta dozens of millions Euro without paying significant tax.

Employees of his company, Finstar, have inquired about the possibility of Boyko becoming a member of Malta Global Residence Program, which offers its members 15 per cent tax on all personal incomes.</p><p>For this reason he rented an apartment in Malta in January 2015 for 1,600 Euro monthly rent through another Bahamas based company, Vigo Trading Limited. But, according to available information, he is not listed in this program.</p><p>Boyko did not answer the question on whether he is becoming a Maltese resident.</p><p>Whether he will succeed or not in his bid to be Maltese, in the coming months Boyko&rsquo;s 15 million Euro luxury villa Belgiojoso in Blevio at Lake Como awaits him. Also 20 million dollars worth fast 45-meter yacht Blade will make his holiday much more pleasant.
